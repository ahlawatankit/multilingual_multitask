I have nothing available from Miami to Beijing
Well IF I make my dates flexible are there any results
From Beijing to Miami even if I make the dates flexible I get no results which means we just do not have any packages to that destination from that destination

Sorry I do not see any in Berlin
I hear Toronto is a good city

I am limited in the amount of results I can fetch if you could suggest a departure city it would be very helpful to narrow down the selection
In that case I will try Belo Horizonte again
At least I can take the dog to the beach
what is the most highly rated hotel you have in Belo Horizonte
The only hotel I can see in Belo Horizonte is 2.5 stars
Do you have a maximum length of stay
No as long as it fits my budget and is within those dates I gave you earlier
Ok I can book 17 days for two adults at Tranquil Season Hotel for only 1332.83 USD
What are the departure and return dates for that and where is it leaving from
You would leave from Porto on September 9th and return on the 25th
Can you tell me more about what this package includes please
It is a 2.5 star hotel with free breakfast free wifi and free parking
That sounds like a pretty good deal
Ok Consider it booked

ok I am going to shop around before I rush into anything
thanks though
i want to leave Pittsburgh for 9 days
and spend 0 dollars

Is your budget flexible by any chance
I can scrounge up 400 I guess if I raid my mom couch cushions

It offers guests parking and wifi free of charge
that is pretty sweet
how much would the 10 day package be
It would fit right under your budget at 385.50
dope are the hotels in Calgary or Denver nicer tho
There are no nicer hotels in Denver but Calgary is different
it is a 4.0 star hotel next to a university and it offers the same amenities as the Atlanta hotel
I would rather be at a beach than a school can I afford to fly business class to Atlanta
No
fine book that one but economy class I am just stoked to be staying on the beach for under 400
Sounds good I will sign you up for it
Email confirmation is coming your way

Hello Oh my next destination is my home as soon as I get off work
If I ever get off
But you know where I would really love to go
Somewhere with sun anywhere really
Cleveland is so grey and dead this time of year
I have been dreaming of going down to South America
Would I ever be able to get to Campinas from here with 5200 dollars
Sure can You can go for up to 14 days to a 3.5 star hotel in the heart of Campinas close to the mall and cathedral
Get out How much would that cost me hypothetically
3355.13 with economy flights and just 4335.7 for an upgrade to business class
Would I be able to afford a trip to Rio de Janeiro
Yes you can You can afford to stay up to 16 days at a 3.0 star hotel near the park museum and university
Would I have amenities included
What would I pay for that one
The hotels got everything covered With free parking free breakfast and free wifi
The economy seats will cost you 4144.38
Impressive Now I may be being greedy here
If I was to keep my sunshine spree domestic
And went to Atlanta
I am wondering if I could be under budget enough that I would have enough left over for maybe another trip
That is actually very possible For a 10 day stay in a 3.5 star beachside hotel it will just be 1283.2 in business class and 962.67 in economy class
Wow Sweet Well I am still stuck at work as you know
So I cannot book anything

With your budget you can stay there for 8 days
ah very nice Um so what are the amenities
The hotel offers free wifi and breakfast during your stay
not bad not bad
Can you also look at Sacramento packages for me
Of course In Sacramento we can offer you a 10 day stay at a 3.0 star hotel close to the museum
very nice Breakfast and Wifi as well
Yup Plus free parking
Very nice indeed
What do previous guests think of the place
They seem to like it On average guests have rated it 6.91/10
So I suppose I would like that as well but can I check Santiago packages real quick before I do anything
I am sorry to inform you that There is nothing that matches your selections in Santiago
Would you like to go with one of your first two choices
that is fine at least the other two options are nicer
Could you tell me the guest rating for the Milan hotel
It has gathered an amazing 8.37/10 average rating from previous guests
I think I would prefer that one
Italy sounds far more exotic than California anyway
What is the price and dates of travel for that one
It would be 1907.5 for 8 days from September 22 to 28
you know I think I wanna go ahead and book that one
It is done for you Simple as that
Wow great You have been super helpful
I need to get out of Beijing ASAP

I am afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Tel Aviv either
Would you like to leave from another city

Would you like to leave from another city
I am GONNA GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE TEL AVIV TO CANCUN THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH DO YOU UNDERSTAND
I am afraid we do not offer any packages that leave from Tel Aviv

GOODBYE
Goodbye Thank you for using our services
Vacay time woooohooooooo
May I book a trip for you
Listen I am on a budget soooooo I want you to find me the best deal ever understand
We want to go to Phoenix with the kids
How many of you will there be
And where will you be leaving from
There is my wife me her mother and our gaggle of 5 kids
3 adults and 5 children then
Yes that is it we need a good deal
What is your budget and where will you be leaving from
We live in Atlanta and no more than $ 4800 for ALL of us got it
I have an amazing 15 day package costing at a total of $ 4415.39 for all of you
You will be all set up at a 3 star hotel located near a museum and a university and this will include free parking free breakfast and free wifi
Would you like me to book this for you
3 star Got anything better
I am afraid not
That is the most upscale hotel we have of all the packages
What is the guest rating on the 15 day package
it is the same hotel for the two packages that we have and the guest rating is 6.91 out of 10
Would you be interested in booking the 15 day package
NO I would like to see what else you have
Do you have any other hotels or are you giving me just one choice
I am afraid we only have two packages available for what you are looking for and they are both with the same hotel
Would you be interested in booking one of these packages
Can you stop asking me that please We take one vacation every 3 years and I need to look at all my options
If I increase my budget to $ 5800 what can you offer us
I am afraid that increasing your budget will leave you with the same options with the 3 star hotel
Is there another destination you would like me to search for you
it is nice that you are meeting my budget but I really need to look at more than just one 3 star hotel in Phoenix
I will shop around and get back to you if I cannot find something better
Have a nice day
Thank you for stopping by Good luck
hi i need to get the hell out of minneapolis
Where would you like to go
i havent taken any vacation days in like 2 years im off though from septmeber 12th to 25th
maybe essen
Do you have a budget for your vacation
nope i am treating myself
Are you going by yourself
yes getting away from it all everything
We have a 5 day and 6 day package at a 2 star hotel in Essen
oh dear a 2 star hotel for my one vacation in all this time anything nicer in New York
We have a 13 day and 9 day package at a 2.5 star hotel in New York
hm marginally better
what are the nearby attractions any nice amenities maybe a relaxing spa
It is near a museum and the airport
They offer free parking breakfast and wifi
sounds dull what about in essen
They offer free wifi and parking
and anything nice nearby
Nothing nearby according to my database
i must say i am pretty disappointed with this
can you check Ciudad Juarez as a saving grace
We have an 8 day and 4 day package at a 3.5 star hotel
They offer free parking breakfast and wifi and they are near a palace they also have a 8.8/10 guest rating
oh god finally something optimistic how much for the 8 day package
789.12 for economy flights included and 971.12 for business flights included
amazing I will take it
business flights
Awesome Well your flights are booked
You will receive email confirmation soon
Is there anything else I can help you with
nope you have taken great care of me thanks
hi
Hello How may I be of help
im just exhausted i need to get out of toluca
and i cant make up my mind where to go
i know a couple places but
i dunno
maybe you can tell me which is better
I would love to help with that
When would you like to take this trip
well i am off from the 15th to 26th of september
And how much budget do you have for this trip
i do not really have one i need to treat myself within reason of course
In that case I will let you know a few offerings we have and we can start from there
Given your selections We have got a 13 day trip to Paris and 11 day trips to Detroit Atlanta Kyoto Hiroshima and Essen
These are the longest trips we offer
oh wow thanks but i was actually thinking about going to porto alegre
No problem
In Porto we can offer you a 5 day stay at a 3.5 star hotel next to shopping a university and a mall
that is alright i would rather be near like a park beach garden something like that I have just been cooped up in an office for ages so outdoor attractions would be better
We have no particular hotels in Porto close to outdoor attractions
Would you like to try another destination
ahh ok well i was also thinking about denver
We only have a 3.0 star hotel in Denver that matches your needs however it is not particularly close to any outdoor activities
hm well how else does it suit my needs
It works well with your dates since it is a 10 day trip from September 15 to 24 and it is in your destination of choice
ah ok maybe you could go back to those places you mentioned before i would like to hear about Hiroshima
Sure in Hiroshima we can bring you to a 3.0 star hotel with 7.15/10 guest ratings near a museum
what about Kyoto
In Kyoto we also have a 3 star hotel near a museum
This one has 8.69/10 guest ratings
nice which is cheaper hiroshima or kyoto
Hiroshima would be an 11 day trip for 4164.55 while Kyoto would be an 8 day trip for 3435.68
gotcha well I like the kyoto place more
what is the hotel called
It is none but the Sakura Inn
ok what is the Paris option you mentioned earlier
Our Paris trip includes a 13 day stay at a prestigious 4.0 star hotel with 8.49/10 rating for 2888.25
wow that is better than the others so far is it near anything cool
I do not have any information on that unfortunately
ah that is ok seems like the best deal I will take it
Sure I will book it for you you are headed to Paris from September 15 to 26
much appreciated thanks

tell me about the santos hotel
it is a 3 star hotel with 8.37/10 previous guest ratings and it is next to shopping
Free breakfast and wifi is available during the stay
not bad not bad I would bank on that 8.37 as my sell point for those other 12 packages are any of them super cheap and swanky
Nothing cheaper and also better than the Santos option
so Santos is the cheapest cheapest with a 3 star rating at least
The 12 days in Buenos Aires is slightly cheaper at 1484.67 But the hotel only has a guest rating of 6.61/10

Anywhere I have 6400 also and my assistant will be joining me
I have a lot of packages available at the Glorious Bazaar resort in Kyoto
Its 3 stars and near a museum
Breakfast and wifi are both complimentary
What is the price and the dates of travel
That depends on where you leave from
What are my options
You can leave from Columbus Cancun Cairo Los Angeles St Louis Athens Dublin or Indianapolis
Where is the cheapest place to leave from
Out of the above locations St Louis is the cheapest with a 13 day package for 4453.91 USD
Okay Is the hotel near a park or a beach
No just a museum
that wont work then Do you have anything in Busan
I sure do The Smile Hotel in Busan is rated 3 stars 7.06/10 by guests and is near both a park and a museum

Leaving from Seattle the cost for a 13 day stay from September 17 to 28 would be 5160.6 USD with economy class flights
okay Do you have anything to Santos near a park but with a lower price than the Busan package
I can likely find you a lower price to Busan if you suggest a different departure city
I do not care where I depart from
