and two boxcars from Elmira to Corning 
mm-hm 
pick up one tanker 
mm-hm 
okay engine two we just send that along from Elmira to Corning to Bath to pick up two of the boxcars at Bath 
and then we take engine two and one boxcar from Elmira to Corning 
and then load um two boxcars 
hm can we do this at the same time 
uh 
these are some things cause we need 
sure I mean you can start you have to be careful you donot put two things on the same track and going in opposite directions 
oh okay let see 
but but um it was okay what what um we only need one boxcar of OJ right 
mm yes 
so why donot we just make that do that one separately 
okay 
let just go get the oranges 
um 
get the 
cause we got we got until three pm so there there not much time 
okay 
constraints really 
okay so we take engine two 
okay 
along with two boxcars take that bring that to Corning 
mm-hm 
and then load the oranges 
one boxcar two or how many boxcars 
two 
okay 
how long would that take 
that that take two hours to get there and one hour to load so three hours in all 
okay and then how long will it take to bring the oranges from Corning to Bath to Avon 
Corning to Bath to Avon um it take uh six hours from Corning to Avon 
so what the total on that 
uh nine nine hours 
nine so we arriving in Avon with the two um boxcars of oranges at what time nine am 
let see we we cannot start oh right 
that too early 
nine am right so so um why donot you just have it wait in Bath 
can it do that 
sure 
okay so wait in Bath and then how long does it take to go from Bath to Avon 
uh four hours 
okay so um at eleven 
right 
we send that to Avon 
right 
okay and then with um engine three 
yep 
at Elmira 
yep 
we bring that how long does it take to bring it uh bring that from Elmira to Corning 
two hours 
two hours and then to Dansville 
uh another hour 
and to bring one boxcar

uh another hour so we we at four hours 
four and then to load the boxcar of with oranges 
um another hour 
and that takes no time to bring a tanker 
no I mean uh yes it takes no time 
okay and then bring all that from Corning to Elmira 
that another two hours 
so what time are we at now when we arrive at Elmira 
uh it seven am 
okay so that right um 
well it takes us an hour to unload but is that I I if that okay 
mm-hm 
I donot think there any 
it just says that they due to be processed at the factory in Elmira at seven seven am sharp 
is that alright 
uh I guess so yes I think so 
okay so we make the OJ there in Elmira 
right 
so um we at seven now how long will it take to bring that tanker to Corning to Bath to Avon 
uh two 
well it takes one hour to make the oranges to make the OJ 
mm-hm 
so that eight 
so right eight and then two more hours to get to Corning that ten and two more hours to get to Bath that twelve and then four hours to get to Avon 
so we still okay because um that after three pm 
yep 
that right 
okay 
okay 
I now finished 
okay 
hello can I help you 
okay I just wondering if the information the everything but the last two sentences does not seem to be really necessary is that is that right 
that okay 
okay um then I guess what we need to do is uh in order to we need to transport two boxcars of oranges to Avon by nine am um 
so two boxcars of oranges to Avon 
by nine am 
okay 
um how long does it take to to get an engine um say with two boxcars um Corning and then to Dansville and then to Avon 
um well which engine are which engine 
engine number two with two boxcars from Elmira 
okay um if we just were just to run the the train straight through 
uh we have to and loading uh both boxcars with oranges at Corning 
at Corning okay it takes two hours to get to Corning 
mm-hm 
loading takes one hour so that three and then which way do you want to go to Avon 
uh to Dansville 
okay um takes four hours to go from Corning to Avon over Dansville 
okay 
so that three uh six seven hours 
so that seven 
so we fine then huh 
yep that okay 
okay 
that work 
hello can I help you 
okay um our task is to get uh the maximum number of oranges to Bath by seven am and it midnight so we have seven hours 
um let see 
okay maximum amount of oranges 
um well we have if we take let see how long would it take to get to take engine well let see engine number two with two boxcars 
mm-hm 
um 
and and you you can start two engines at the same time 
yep 
okay if we start um engine one uh to uh start it on its way to Dansville 
mm-hm 
um and start engine number two um with two boxcars from Elmira 
okay 
okay and take well take engine number two 
mm-hm 
um with two boxcars to Corning 
mm-hm 
and pick up uh and pick up your oranges 
mm-hm 
and then um go uh see um then I guess we have to take that to Bath 
right 
um and then at the same time though have engine number one um picking up boxcars the three boxcars in Dansville 
right 
and uh and then uh taking those boxcars to Corning 
okay 
um so how well let see how much time would it take for the I guess the longer trip would be from Avon to Corning right 
to yes that right that take four hours 
four hours 
right 
and the loading takes an hour each for each boxcar or 
no you can load all the boxcars or you can load a set of boxcars in an hour 
okay so that will be what five hours when by the time we get done loading in Corning 
yeah right of engine one right 
okay 
right um hm 
I guess we not gonna be able to make it back in time 
for another load 
if we did 
well I mean we have to get them we have to get oh how long does it take to get from Corning to Bath two hours 
two hours yeah 
oh so that would be perfect if we do it that if we uh 
with engine one 
with engine one 
right 
so that the maximum we can get with engine one 
right 
see engine two takes how long two hours to get from Elmira to Corning 
that right one hour to load 
one that three and then then there be 
another two hours 
okay so as that would be the maximum too would it 
yeah that right 
cause cause we cannot get back to Corning to load the other two that are at Bath 
that right that right 
so the maximum number is five then right 
yep 
okay 
okay 
hello can I help you 
okay we have to take um two tankers of orange juice to Avon um and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira 
and the bananas must arrive by nine pm it doesnot specify any time for the uh for the orange juice to arrive at Avon 
so I uh we probably should do the the bananas first 
okay 
where do the bananas go to 
uh the bananas go to um to Elmira 
Elmira okay 
and it also says that all the all the engines except for E two are going undergoing routine maintenance we can only use engine E two 
okay 
um let see uh 
well like I said we should we should do the bananas first 
okay 
um and we need three boxcars of of uh bananas so I say we take E two 
um and we have to get to where Elmira oh boy uh 
do you have to go all the way to Avon 
right and we should yeah let just that what two is it four from Avon to Dansville 
three hours 
three okay so so it six hours total to get there 
yes 
and then boy is it possible to do oh no nine pm okay I sorry 
yeah 
I I didnot say nine I said nine am didnot I 
right yeah 
okay so 
so nine pm so that makes it easier 
right um but in it in it it is midnight now too right 
yes 
okay so I I I thinking the best thing to do would be to do the bananas first since they the things with the time limit 
right 
um so let go all the way to uh to Avon through Dansville 
hm 
okay 
cause I think that the shorter way so that six hours and then then and we already have and we have to load the three boxcars that we picked up in Dansville 
yeah it shorter 
right 
so it another hour 
right 
and then the six hours back so we what thirteen hours 
right 
um so that get us back at about one 
one pm 
um so that good and now now we have to transport two tankers of orange juice to Avon 
and does it take any time to unload the the boxcars 
um yeah it takes one hour to unload 
okay um 
but you gotta load them all at once that that to take things out of them 
mm-hm 
to uncouple them it only takes it instantaneous 
okay um okay let see well maybe we two oh it tankers so we donot need to unload them anyway or we donot we donot need to uh spend time unloading them cause we can just unhook them 
right 
um okay so we in Elmira it one pm 
yep 
now let get the two tankers at Corning 
um and fill them up with orange juice so that gonna three hours 
wait a minute um we have to make the orange juice 
oh okay okay yeah oh yeah I see 
orange warehouse okay then we take oh boy so now we have to oh we can take the two boxcars that we have in uh Elmira right 
yep 
and take those to uh Corning to pick up the oranges 
okay 
um and that take three hours right including loading 
uh let see two yeah that right 
and then back to Elmira to make the orange juice 
right 
so that five 
yep 
and then it takes six to get to Avon so that another eleven 
that right 
and whatever time that be that two in the morning 
and then we done 
right 
the next day but it doesnot matter right 
right exactly 
okay so we done 
okay 
hello can I help you 
alright we have to get seven boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine am and it now twelve midnight 
so we got nine hours 
um I think what we need to do here is is uh take engine E one to Dansville and pick up uh and pick up the three boxcars there 
okay 
and um and at the same time uh what it okay since the since these let see we have two engines in Elmira 
so we need to take one of those um to Corning and then to uh to Bath 
to pick up the two boxcars there okay 
okay 
and that will start at the same time as um uh 
as the engine from E one 
right and I can engine E can can two of the engines be going the same way on the same track 
no uh the same way yes 
the same way right 
yeah 
okay so if we take E three and start it right behind with the two boxcars that are already in Elmira we can take that to Corning 
yes 
okay um now uh once that is done the um what time would that be let see 
so let see you got two engines in Corning is that what you mean 
mm-hm 
then I have 
well wait we have well one engine let see yeah one engine will be in Corning one will be in Bath picking up the other two boxcars 
three 
uh okay 
and the other one will be in Dansville and E one will be in Dansville 
with the three boxcars 
um with the three boxcars 
um now that by the by the time let see what would take the longest time of those three 
the probably the trip from Avon to Corning takes 
well actually that getting getting from Elmira to Corning to Bath and then back again 
okay 
that gonna take the well it gonna take two four six hours to get back to Corning with those two boxcars 
okay 
okay 
um 
okay I see yep and uh so that but that alright 
um we can load the uh now we can we have we can have three engines in Corning at the same time right 
yes 
okay so by the time that E one gets to Corning with its three boxcars it gonna be um 
four am 
four okay 
so we can just we can just take those or load those that be five um five am and then take them back and that seven am 
yep 
um but the one that gonna take the longest time is the one we really have to be concerned about right 
yeah 
and that gonna that get back exactly at nine 
so so wait a minute so at seven say at seven am 
right it uh the one that takes the longest is the one that goes down to Bath right 
right so and that one will get there at get if once it gets loaded at the orange warehouse 
that right 
it by the time it gets back to Elmira it be nine 
that right 
okay so let just make sure we donot uh donot have any cars going in uh opposite directions we not we donot okay fine 
I think we all set 
so so let see the the one boxcar coming from Avon 
right 
takes three I sorry the one engine from Avon takes three boxcars 
yep 
to Elmira so that three 
uh though the engine that going to Bath takes two boxcars that two more 
and then the the first engine that took the boxcars from Elmira 
that the shortest trip 
mm-hm 
takes another two so that seven yep that work 
alright 
okay 
hello can I help you 
alright we have to ship two boxcars of bananas and one boxcar of oranges to Dansville using only one engine 
and have that has to be the shipment must be unloaded by one pm so that gives us thirteen hours to do all that 
okay 
um I think maybe using engine E one and taking the take making the trip to um Dansville 
and then to pick up the three boxcars 
okay 
and then that takes what three hours 
takes 
well three hours one way 
and okay and then to get back to the bananas service is six to load is seven 
alright we wanna be loading two at the banana warehouse but 
that okay it takes only one hour to load 
right 
you just have to load them in parallel 
okay 
so that um seven hours and then three back is ten 
seven hours 
so we have three to work with um and then uh it one to Corning 
one hour to Corning yeah 
okay oh this this I donot know if this is gonna work now 
well we only need two boxcars of bananas right 
right 
so we could just we donot have to wait for them to be unloaded we just unhitch them 
oh okay 
and then take the remaining boxcar down to 
okay 
right to 
Corning 
Corning 
yeah 
and that uh 
and that takes one two three hours with the loading 
okay 
oh what and then we have to unload right 
or unload them 
right so that gonna be 
that four hours 
so how long did it take us to get 
I think it think that gonna add up to fourteen let see um Avon to pick up the three and get back to Avon is six right to load is is seven 
right and then 
and then back is ten 
okay and then 
then we then we need four hours in order to be able to to get to Corning load and get back and then and then unload 
right 
so that that one hour more than we 
than we have 
than we have 
okay so 
maybe 
engine E one was maybe it was the best thing 
um 
see if we try with 
cause we have to mm maybe we try like taking two boxcars of er well taking one boxcar would be sufficient 
when and if we took or no wait here here we go 
oh let go down to Bath 
I 
yeah 
yeah 
if if we take um let see because we have to we have to get the bananas too 
yeah 
so this we have to get to Avon somehow 
yeah I think you I think you right yeah let stick with E one 
uh E one 
right because it takes us to get from Elmira to get from Elmira to Dansville 
mm-hm 
it gonna take us three hours 
okay 
oh let see yeah and then another three hours to Avon 
and we have to get there like you said for the bananas and that so that takes six hours so it the same 
alright 
as just using E one 
oh we can take care of the oranges right off quick 
oh that that 
right on on the way 
that a good point that a good point let do yeah you right 
okay so why donot we take um take two boxcars from or well actually it really doesnot matter 
we just pick up the boxcars at at uh Elmira with engine E two and taking them to the to Corning 
right 
and load them up and that what total of three hours 
yep 
and then take those and then go to Dansville 
so that uh let see and that one more hour 
and 
yeah and we can we can 
drop off at the 
drop off that boxcar and take well yeah drop off the boxcar of 
and then take two empty ones 
right two empty ones down to to Avon 
and pick up the the bananas 
right 
now how long is that let see 
okay so Elmira to Corning is two and loading is three and to Dansville is four 
yep 
okay so that and then we done with the oranges 
yeah and then eight to Avon right 
and then we go 
three to 
well it only three that right okay so it 
yeah right right so three to Avon and back again so and back again will be seven 
right 
with the with the loading 
then eight to unload 
okay 
right so it eight plus four twelve hours 
so we be just right 
so that be perfect 
okay 
yeah actually we a bit early 
we a little little better 
yeah okay 
hello can I help you 
yes okay I looking to ship three boxcars of bananas and three tankers of OJ to Bath 
okay so I have boxcars in Elmira and tankers in Corning right 
mm-hm 
and I need to where are the bananas oh the bananas so I have an engine in Avon but not a boxcar 
so would I have to take an engine and then go to Bath and pick up a boxcar and then come back how long is that from 
so Avon to Bath is four hours 
okay and I donot have any time limit so I suppose it doesnot really matter 
it twelve now and okay so I go to three box oh I only have two there oh okay sorry I go to Dansville 
and pick up three boxcars how long is that 
that three hours 
okay so I go to Dansville pick up the three boxcars with my engine 
now where am I going I going to Bath okay and then I fill it up with bananas those three boxcars how long does that take 
uh filling takes one hour 
okay filling so that another hour three one four and then I just ship those to Bath 
okay 
and that four hours you said 
mm-hm 
and then three tankers of OJ 
uh so I go from Corning to Elmira which is how long 
Corning to Elmira is two hours 
okay with my tankers fill up my tankers which takes uh an hour 
yes 
okay and then drive from Elmira to Bath 
yes 
and that should complete the task I would think 
hello can I help you 
yes okay I looking to ship one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges and one tanker of OJ to Bath all by noon today and it is twelve midnight 
so let see one boxcar of bananas okay well I suppose one boxcar of oranges well to Bath hm 
okay well I guess I just take my engine from Avon to Dansville which is three hours 
and pick up two boxcars 
um go back where should we okay go from Dansville to Corning which is how long two hours 
Dansville to Corning is one hour 
one hour um then fill up one of the boxcars with oranges and 
um there are oranges at Corning 
there are 
oh no sorry there are yeah 
okay 
right and um hm then I guess is it faster to go from Corning to Avon or from Corning like through Bath or through Dansville is my question 
okay it faster to go to from Corning to Avon through Dansville that takes four hours 
okay 
okay so I go back the the way I came and then fill up the second car with bananas 
wait I not keeping track of the time am I 
okay that three hours to Dansville it twelve midnight now so it three in the morning another hour 
mm-hm one hour to Corning 
okay one hour Corning that four in the morning an hour to load right 
one hour to load yep 
that five in the morning I still have plenty of time and then and then it four hours back 
four hours back 
so where was I five nine in the morning one hour to load that ten in the morning right 
mm-hm 
and then how many hours to Bath from Avon 
um Bath from Avon is four 
oh then we not gonna make it by twelve are we um 
hm 
you have to 
oh I can go I can go from Avon pick up the two boxcars right 
and then go to Corning 
well no it doesnot make any sense either way anyway then so we a little late 
and would the 
so what your task it to take one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges 
and one tanker of OJ to Bath to the I can take a tanker from Corning to Elmira in how many hours 
Corning to Elmira takes two hours 
so two load one hour and then from Elmira to Bath 
Elmira to Bath is four hours 
it four hours so um two three so we can get that there by seven in the morning 
then that not a problem but I donot see how I can get the boxcar of bananas and the boxcar of oranges to Bath by twelve if we gotta go all over the place to pick up the boxcars 
is it possible to get one and 
maybe you could start with a different engine 
different engine yeah 
you donot have to start in Avon I suppose 
yeah I guess so well okay so I start in Elmira with one engine and the two boxcars 
mm-hm 
okay and then I can drive straight to Corning 
mm-hm 
from Elmira which is how many hours again 
Elmira to Corning is two hours 
two hours so that two in the morning one hour to load 
mm-hm 
and then four hours from Corning to Avon right 
four hours from Corning to Avon yes 
okay so that was three in the morning seven in the morning an hour to load 
that eight in the morning and then four hours oh that okay then that works and then we make it by twelve 
um how are you getting the orange juice 
oh well I I already said that that was um that was to um take a tanker from Corning to to Elmira which is an hour an hour to load 
no Corning to Elmira is two hours 
two hours oh okay 
so that and then an hour to load which is makes it uh three in the morning 
and then four hours to Bath correct 
right well why donot you keep the whole 
I cannot separate it 
well you could but it be faster just you have to start with the engine well either in Elmira or Avon right 
right 
and then you have to get to the oranges and then back to the orange juice factory 
I have to bring the oranges to the orange juice factory 
I believe so 
donot they have oranges there 
I think you have to 
I have to 
okay this is getting complicated 
so I have to not only but no my my problem is to get a boxcar of bananas a boxcar of oranges and one tanker of orange juice to Bath 
it doesnot say they all have to arrive at the same time or all have to go together 
right but it 
but they just have to be there by noon 
okay so let go through your plan 
okay 
so what your plan 
my plan is to go well first we work on the orange juice 
okay 
I have a tanker in Corning 
mm-hm 
I drive the tanker from Corning to Elmira 
you cannot drive the tanker without an engine 
a tanker 
the tanker needs an engine 
I thought a tanker was just truck or is it a 
it one of those round things that gets pulled by an engine 
oh with it part of the train oh I see okay and then that that why I was confused 
okay so we start in 
start in Elmira 
Elmira with two boxcars in we go to Corning and we pick up a a tanker 
mm-hm 
and then we go back to Elmira 
okay 
um so it two hours there two hours back that four hours fill up an hour that five in the morning 
well if you gonna make orange juice you have to pick up orange juice it in Corning in order to make orange juice 
I have to pick up oranges and then for them to make orange juice I have to bring them the oranges 
exactly 
okay so 
so 
okay um picking up an engine and two boxcars in Elmira I going to Corning picking up a tanker an hour for loading 
mm-hm 
so that three in the morning 
so 
three in the morning 
and then from Corning to Elmira it another two hours that five 
another hour to load that six 
okay 
and then I drive from Elmira back to Corning 
okay 
I guess I could 
you could filled up two for the price of one 
fill the 
okay so I done that 
so 
you already done that fine 
okay so I go straight to Avon and I get the bananas 
so that another 
four 
four hours is that right okay 
and then another hour for loading are you keeping track of what time it is or should I 
um so should we should be at eleven I think 
eleven but that that doesnot give enough still doesnot give us enough time to get to Bath right 
cause it what another three hours or four hours 
right 
so we cannot make it in time then it be late 
well maybe we could use separate engines 
okay yeah I suppose fine 
alright so I can send them out both at the same time right 
right 
both engines can go at the same time 
okay so one engine will go to do what I just said and just do the orange juice right 
right so it will go from Corning to Bath at the end 
right 
okay 
right and then the other engine will go with the two boxcars and do what I said 
you know by going from Elmira to Avon oh Elmira stopping in Corning and then oh 
no the other engine can start at Avon go to Dansville back to Avon and pick up the bananas and go to Bath 
that time oh start at but it okay yeah should I I mean that fine with me 
oh actually no it 
I think that would be 
okay so what you final plan 
okay first off I using both engines from Elmira 
okay 
one is gonna go by itself and pick up one tanker of can I carry oranges in tankers 
no 
then I cannot do that then 
you can take boxcars with you at there are boxcars available at Elmira 
three right two well I guess alright and then I pick up another one on the way 
alright so each engine has one boxcar I go to Corning one of the engine goes picks up a they both fill up with oranges that another hour 
okay so we at three in the morning 
right 
okay 
so and then one of the engines heads back to Elmira 
okay

five am and then loads picks up a tanker 
alright 
and then and then fills up with orange juice 
so that six am

is it it is faster to go from Corning to Dansville correct and then to Avon 
um let see yes to Dansville and and Avon is faster 
okay so at the time now it will be five am in the morning how late would it be to get to Dansville 
okay five am at Corning then six am at Dansville um 
mm-hm 
nine am at Avon 
okay and it seems like the task will be completed way before three pm thank you 
hi can I help you 
yes hi system 
I need to uh ship one boxcar of bananas and one boxcar of oranges and one tanker of orange juice to Bath 
all these commodities must be in Bath by noon and it already midnight alright so first let let deal with the boxcar full of bananas 
um the banana warehouse is in is in Avon 
and the boxcars um the nearest available boxcars are in Dansville 
right 
so we have to take an engine from Avon to Dansville in order to pick up the boxcar returning pick up the bananas 
so how far is the distance between Avon and Dansville 
three hours 
okay so the engine will go to Dansville and pick up a boxcar how long will it take to hitch up 
uh no time at all 
okay so we hitch up that and come straight back that six hours right 
right 
okay oh my goodness and we will fill it full of bananas how long will it fill take to fill one thing boxcar of bananas 
one hour 
okay so one hour and we will leave from Avon to Bath immediately 
what time will we get into Bath 
starting at midnight um 
mm-hm 
three hours six hours seven hours um eleven am 
eleven am okay ooh what time does it and how okay eleven am that just fine we have to be in by noon 
okay now let deal with the boxcar of oranges 
orange warehouse is in Corning there three tankers available but they for some reason want a boxcar 
so we gonna have to get a boxcar and let take engine number three 
okay 
is there is one engine or engine two or three which one faster 
they equally fast 
equally fast okay let take engine number three hitch one of the boxcars and leave for Corning that one hour is that 
two hours 
two hours okay two hours to Corning and we will fill it with um oranges and that takes one hour 
yes 
okay so we got three hours total now and into Bath immediately we what time would we have 
it will take two hours so that be a total of five hours 
five hours okay five hours seems fine because that will put us in at five am this morning if we leave now right 
yes 
okay now we still have to deal with now we still have to deal with our tanker of orange juice 
alright 
um the tankers are only in available in Corning so to get the orange juice we have to go to Elmira which is two hours 
and how long will it take to fill a tanker full of orange juice 
one hour 
okay that three hours right there turn around come directly back to Corning that two more that five hours and it one hour to Bath or two 
two hours 
okay seven hours total 
but you donot have an engine at Corning to move the tanker 
I didnot I was aware that the tankers had to be 
yes they have to have an engine 
they have to have an engine these are not trucks okay first why donot we take the engine from Elmira 
alright 
and the 
you mean engine E two 
yes let take engine E two from Elmira and to Corning pick up the tanker come back to Elmira 
and fill it full of orange juice come back and then to Bath what time do we have then 
let see that five hours after filling it with orange juice and then from Elmira to Bath um seven eight nine hours 
so if we start at um midnight you should be in at nine am 
mm-hm 
um but you got both engine E three and engine E two on the same track between Elmira and Corning at the same time and that would work 
correct okay so what we gonna have to do is we gonna have to import an engine for either one 
actually an engine can carry um a boxcar and a tanker at the same time 
well would that be handy okay 
so what we do is the boxcar of bananas which is coming from Avon is that correct 
we are picking up an we picking up a boxcar in Dansville coming back getting the bananas right 
on our way instead of going directly into Bath 
mm-hm 
could we go on to Corning and pick up a tanker 
wait wait wait okay so so this is engine E one that you talking about that went to 
engine E one goes to Dansville to get a boxcar right 
right 
and then it comes back and fills full of bananas 
right 
instead of going to Bath how about if it went to Corning ooh how about this it can go into Bath drop off the bananas 
and then go to Corning pick up a tanker 
go to Elmira and fill the tanker full of orange juice 
this may be taking too much time cause you already you got it oh alright so instead of going to Dansville you just gonna go straight to Bath alright that skips some time 
right 
so what we doing now is we got we got our engine one in the banana warehouse 
mm-hm 
first it has to go to Dansville because it needs a boxcar then it comes back to Avon that two hours right 
uh it six hours to Dansville so that um excuse me it three hours to Dansville so that six hours total 
ooh 
okay and now it fills the bananas and it goes to Bath 
okay 
now how what time is it now it at eleven am right 
six um six seven eight nine ten yeah eleven am 
alright it drops off the bananas 
mm-hm 
ooh doesnot work it too much time 
yes it takes an hour to unload the bananas so 
the bananas will just be in underneath the neck okay so now the bananas are a different issue let just deal with the oranges 
alright oranges we have to get an engine for it so we go to Elmira and we get engine number two 
we come back to Corning and we will 
now wait who who going to Elmira so you starting with engine E two at Elmira 
okay yes that right 
engine at okay engine at Elmira comes to Corning and it gets tanker oh and it brings with it a boxcar 
okay 
okay 
so from Elmira to Corning with boxcar we then we fill up the boxcar with oranges 
okay 
and then hm we how about we go back to Elmira and then fill up with the orange ooh no no no gracious gracious bad bad move 
how about this we get the engine we get a boxcar oh that all we can do go to Elmira I mean go to Corning fill with oranges come back fill with orange juice and then go all the way down 
yes 
okay what that 
but you can you can carry more than one boxcar if you worried about the oranges as well 
oh no I only need one one boxcar 
okay 
okay 
and um what time will that get us into Bath 
okay so it so engine E two goes to Corning that two hours fills up that three am goes to Elmira 
with tanker 
um with the tanker okay um 
that five am and now you load up with orange juice so that six am 
mm-hm 
and now we have to get to Bath 
so through Corning at eight am and then to Bath at ten am 
okay thank you very much sounds like a plan 
great thank you 
hi can I help you 
hi system 
I need to ship two boxcars of bananas and one boxcar of oranges to Dansville by noon using only one engine for some unknown reason 
it is now midnight and the shipload must be unloaded by one pm so we got some serious time restrictions here 
firstly we need to get um two boxcars from Dansville that the closest right 
between from Avon 
oh you trying to where are you trying to get Avon 
yes 
yeah 
okay 
because that where the banana warehouse is 
alright 
okay we need to get two boxcars so why donot we go to Dansville and pick up two boxcars 
uh which engine did you want to use 
engine number one 
okay 
actually why donot we pick up all three boxcars 
alright 
and we come back to Avon and we will fill them with two of them with bananas 
okay 
ooh but actually I got even a better idea 
well instead of that let go from let instead of going straight back to um the banana warehouse let take it to from Dansville to Corning fill it with the oranges in one of the boxcars 
okay 
and then we go back to Avon and fill it with the two fill it up with the two other boxcars of um bananas 
alright did you want to go through Dansville on the way back 
right 
okay 
on the way back right 
and then we will come hm okay and then okay on the way back to Dansville we drop off the oranges 
uh drop off the oranges at 
Dansville 
at Dansville 
okay let me make sure I doing this right um right 
so you 
and then okay now we only have now we only have two we have all three open boxcars 
uh 
maybe we could even drop a boxcar just leave it and go to Avon fill up with the bananas and come back to Dansville 
you trying to get you trying to get all of the um bananas and the oranges to Avon is that right 
no to Dansville 
no 
to Dansville okay 
okay yep we need two we need two boxcars full of bananas and one boxcar full of oranges to Dansville by noon 
okay 
using only one engine 
okay 
which should be a problem so now our time let figure out our time 
got our engine it goes to Dansville and picks up all three or it it only needs to pick up one really 
okay 
at this time and goes to Corning 
okay 
fills up with the oranges what time is it now 
so let see gets to Dansville at three am gets to Corning at four am and by the time it filled up it five am 
okay drops off the oranges at six am at Dansville 
yes 
and then it goes 
but it takes an hour to to get the oranges out of the um boxcars so it seven am when it leaves 
okay 
okay can we unhitch the boxcar and just leave it there and pick up hitch up two others 
yes 
okay let do that and save us some time 
okay 
so we um unhitch the boxcar and hitch up two others and leave immediately for Avon 
okay 
with just two boxcars fill it full of bananas and come right back to Dansville 
alright so three hours to get to Avon that nine am you filling two boxcars so that eleven am and then you going straight back to Dansville so that two in the afternoon when you arrive 
mm-hm 
oh gracious not good for time 
okay well we gonna have to do the oranges on another thought cause that didnot take us long so we have to do the bananas first 
okay 
okay 
so let start with the bananas we go from Avon to Dansville with engine number one 
we get two boxcars return to Avon fill boxcars with bananas and go to Dansville and drop off 
okay 
yes 
okay so that all done by nine am 
but it takes two hours to fill the boxcars 
to fill them 
so it eleven am when they get back to Dansville 
that no problem we just unhitch the boxcars in Dansville hitch on one the last remaining boxcar 
okay 
at eleven am go to Corning which is an hour away 
mm-hm 
fill it with the with the oranges and return to Dansville by one pm 
if you leave Dansville at eleven am 
mm-hm 
uh you be at Corning by noon and then it takes an hour to fill the tankers so that be uh one pm and then you want to get back to Dansville so that be two pm when you arrive 
oh gracious they not making this easy are they okay it gonna have to be a different engine wish I thought of this to begin with 
it engine number two let take 
alright 
we take we take let say one it doesnot make a difference how fast a train goes with one or two 
no 
okay 
no 
let just take both take both boxcars from engine number two from Elmira and let drive to Corning 
alright 
fill one of them full of oranges it a two hour jaunt between Elmira and Corning right 
yes 
okay one hour it three hours full and then to Dansville 
okay 
okay and we will unhitch the one filled 
okay 
and we will hitch up another empty one from Dansville 
okay 
and we will go to Avon 
alright 
okay what time is it 
so let see it uh two hours to Corning um three am by the time get the boxcars filled 
then um four am when you get to Dansville and three hours to Avon that seven am 
mm-hm 
okay it seven am fill the both both up so that nine am by the time they both filled 
right 
and return to Dansville
