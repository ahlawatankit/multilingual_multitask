hello can I help you 
yeah I want to determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven am tomorrow morning 
so I guess all the boxcars will have to go through Corning because that where the orange factory is 
so from Corning to Bath how far is that 
two hours 
and it gonna take us also an hour to load boxcars right 
right 
so every trip will take at least three hours then 
um 
right we can unload any amount of cargo onto a train in one hour 
so can we do a maximum of three boxcars in an hour 
right okay 
so I guess one thing is that we should see how many boxcars we can actually get to Corning in four hours 
how far is it from Avon to Bath to Corning 
that six hours it shorter through Dansville 
okay 
from Avon oh no but the thing is is that I was thinking if I was wondering if we could actually pick up those two boxcars which are at Bath 
mm 
but I think that we cannot even put them in to that they would even come in to play 
unless how far is it from Elmira to Bath 
two hours 
oh really so then we could actually take like engine E two 
have it go to bath pick up those two box cars there 
take it to how long from Bath to Corning an hour I guess 
two hours 
oh wait a second I thought well from from like Elmira through to Corning to Bath is how many hours 
four hours 
oh that four hours so we like screwed as far as those two box cars at Bath go 
like I I donot think we so to get the maximum number of box cars of oranges to bath by seven am I donot think we can even use those two at bath 
because there we because we cannot get an engine to Bath in time 
that right 
okay so we have the three boxcars at Dansville 
so how far is it from Avon to Danville 
three hours 
three hours then from Dansville to Corning 
one hour 
okay so we we can actually use those three boxcars right 
mm-hm 
okay so that three boxcars 
okay so that engine E one 
from Avon going to Dansville pick up the three boxcars 
go to Corning load them up and then take it to Bath 
okay so that good 
so then I guess we can also take like engine E two with those two boxcars from Elmira 
take it to Corning 
so Elmira to Corning is two hours 
mm-hm 
okay and okay so yeah that that should also work 
mm-hm 
so so did you wanna repeat that plan 
okay engine E one goes to Dansville picks up three boxcars 
goes to Corning is loaded with oranges and goes to Bath 
engine E two picks takes the two boxcars at Elmira to Corning where they loaded with oranges and then takes them to Bath 
okay so that gives us a maximum number of five okay 
hello can I help you 
um where are the oranges 
uh there are oranges at Corning 
mm-hm 
that actually that the only place where there are there a warehouse at Corning 
okay so from Corning to Bath by eight am today 
okay that means you want to move oranges there 
from Corning to Bath 
okay um 
what you have to do is you have to uh pick out an uh an engine and schedule a train to do that 
okay um engine two 
okay 
from Elmira 
mm-hm 
to Corning 
okay 
and then do I need anything else or can I go straight to Bath 
um you need a boxcar to move the oranges from Corning to Bath 
okay uh take the boxcar from Dansville to Corning 
okay 
so we have to send uh the engine what E two uh from Elmira to Dansville to get the boxcar 
mm-hm 
okay and then back to Corning 
mm-hm 
and then we load oranges 
yep 
and take that to Bath 
yep 
okay

okay 
you have to go to Bath and the boxcars there three available at Dansville 
okay 
and there two available at mira 
that right 
there already two at Bath 
yes there are two at Bath 
okay 
how long would it take from Dansville to Bath 
going the Corning Bath way 
uh 
okay um let see we have to get an engine to Dansville um to pick up the boxcars 
okay 
um but once once the once you have an engine there it take uh three hours to take the boxcars from Dansville to Bath through Corning 
what about Avon 
uh from Avon uh to Dansville that is 
um 
with the engine 
no from Dansville to Bath by Avon 
oh 
oh okay sorry 
uh oh that would be seven hours 
okay we cannot do that 
so it a lot longer 
hm 
mm-hm 
okay take the engine E three from Elmira 
okay 
whoa with the do I I need two do I need two engines for the two boxcars 
uh no you can carry them both on tow both on the same engine 
okay take engine E three with the two boxcars available 
okay 
to um Dansville 
okay 
and that how many hours 
uh that take three hours to get to Dansville 
okay um while at Dansville take the three boxcars so that total of five 
okay 
and then go via Corning to Bath to get the other two which is seven 
oh okay so let see now did the boxcars I cannot remember the problem now did they have to be loaded with anything or 
oh yeah boxcar of oranges 
oh okay 
so we have to stop at Corning to get oranges 
oh okay let me just uh check one one problem we have is when the cars are loaded an engine can only carry three of them 
okay 
uh 
so from Elmira we have to take the second engine 
okay 
engine two 
okay so we can take the second engine also to Corning so let me get this uh so we going to take engine one engine uh with the two boxcars from Elmira 
mm-hm 
we take them through uh let see do we want to take them through to Dansville what we originally suggested 
oh Elmira to Corning to pick up the oranges and then to Bath 
okay so we go with one engine we take uh two boxcars from Elmira to Corning 
then we load the oranges uh in them and uh we take them to Bath 
mm-hm 
that take five hours for that train 
okay 
okay with the other engine uh we going to Corning to Dansville to pick up the other boxcars 
and then back to Corning 
then back to Corning 
to get the oranges 
then we loading we loading the oranges and then we going there and that will take seven hours 
and then to Bath 
okay 
am I finished 
um well let see I guess uh 
cause they had to be by seven am 
right by seven am there probably is time to get any I mean you could go back but no that would it take two hours to go back to Corning so there would be time 
so the total is 
five 
that right okay 
five 
so total is five 
okay 
mm-hm 
finished 
hello can I help you 
okay the problem is there are five boxcars of oranges waiting at Corning 
okay 
I am to take one tanker of orange juice and then deliver the one tanker of orange juice plus four boxcars of oranges to Bath as soon as possible 
okay so that one tanker of orange juice and four 
boxcars 
boxcars oranges to Bath okay as soon as possible 
am I starting at Corning 
uh you can the situation is just the as shown on the map as before 
I need a 
okay 
so you got the engines at Elmira and uh 
Avon 
Avon 
okay I guess with one engine will I be able to take the tanker plus four boxcars no I need two right 
no you need two engines 
okay um take the two engines from Elmira engine two and three 
okay 
and we can get the orange juice from Elmira and take 
we have to make the orange juice actually so we have to get oranges um from Corning and move them to Elmira to make the orange juice 
oh 
okay so engine two goes to Corning 
okay 
to get oranges 
okay 
and take it back to Elmira 
okay so we take a we need one right so we take one boxcar with us as we go 
mm-hm yeah 
okay so that be two hours to Corning uh to pick up the oranges one hour to load plus two hours to get back 
um and then one hour to make the orange juice 
so then we would have so that would be after six hours we have the tanker of orange juice at ready at Elmira 
is there a quicker way 
um 
no that looks about the fastest one thing we will need we need a a tanker car to transport the orange juice 
okay when we at when we at Corning can we take it back with us 
yes 
yes okay so when we at Corning we uh pick up a tanker car 
okay and we go back with the oranges in the tanker car make the orange juice and we can load it in the tanker car 
okay then uh 
okay then the is one engine able to carry a tanker plus two boxcars 
yes 
okay so the engine with the tanker 
mm-hm 
will take two additional boxcars 
okay 
Uh and go to Corning where we will pick up oranges to put in the boxcars 
okay 
and then straight to Bath 
okay so that take uh two hours to get to Corning an hour to load the oranges and two hours to get to Bath 
so that be another five hours okay so then it be eleven 
and then the other engine will have one boxcar right 
uh the other engine 
it would have any 
no it would have any 
okay 
yeah 
so the second the third engine whatever which one was still there 
will go has to go to Corning to Dansville 
okay 
to pick up another well another two boxcars 
and then back down to Corning to load the oranges 
okay so it take three hours to get to Dansville 
and uh we pick up the boxcars and go back to Corning 
and then we gotta load oranges we take another hour 
um and then two hours to get to Bath so that will total will take uh seven hours to do that 
okay 
is there there no other quicker way right 
uh I donot think so let see what so the one that takes the longest is to make the orange juice 
and there doesnot seem to be a quicker way to do that because we have to go get the oranges and back again 
right no that looks like the fastest 
okay so 
but do we still need one more boxcar 
uh 
I think 
no I think we have two with the first engine with the the we have the orange juice in two oh how many did we need 
uh 
we needed five so well 
oh we needed five in uh total 
yeah well 
oh we need one more yes 
so 
oh what we 
couldnot we just attach that you said three boxcars were for one engine 
right we could just taken three from Dansville 
okay then the problem finished 
right okay 
hello can I help you 
okay the problem is to get six boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine a.m. nine am and it now midnight 
okay at nine am 
okay each engine can only carry three right 
that right 
okay 
so there two available at Elmira already 
yes 
so the um one engine at Elmira will take the two boxcars 
okay 
and go to Corning to Dansville to pick up another one 
okay so yes okay Corning and then to Dansville pick up a boxcar and back 
so that will have three and then we can load the oranges 
at Corning 
right mm-hm 
and go back 
and go back 
to Elmira 
okay so that would take a total of seven hours and that would give us three boxcars of oranges 
okay 
and then the other engine at Elmira okay will have to go the same so there two boxcars left still at Dansville right 
right 
okay and so both engines can like the other engine can work at the same time right 
yes mm-hm 
so one engine the the first engine will go back to Dansville 
okay 
by Corning and get the other two 
so this is engine E one is it 
E two 
E two okay 
and the other we used E three for the other other train 
is that right right okay mm-hm 
yeah 
so E two- E two is going back to Dansville through Corning 
um right 
and then they have two boxcars 
they get two boxcars mm-hm 
go back to Corning to fill up and then back to Elmira 
right 
okay 
but at the same time 
so then that takes that takes seven hours to do that and that gets us another two boxcars 
so there total of five right 
that a total of five 
and all this can happen at the same time right well 
yeah that can happen at the same time 
okay 
how long will it take to go from Elmira to Corning to Bath 
Elmira to Corning to Bath is uh four hours 
okay um 
take would it be possible it already seven hours and I only have till nine am 
mm-hm 
right 
would it be possible to how long from Avon to Bath 
Avon to Bath is uh four hours 
okay um take engine one from Avon 
okay 
to go to Bath 
to go to Bath 
where it going to pick up the additional two boxcars 
right 
which will make seven 
mm-hm 
and to Corning 
right okay 
which is how many hours 
uh that get take six hours to get to Corning 
and how many from Corning to Elmira 
um that will work cause it take one hour to load and then two hours to get to Elmira 
okay 
so that get us there exactly by nine am 
so there is now seven boxcars of oranges in Elmira right 
that uh that right let oh let me just check that we donot have two trains uh trying to cross each other on the same track 
okay 
um but I donot think that happening I just wait a sec I check that 
okay 
no there no problem there so yeah that uh that gets us seven boxcars there by nine am 
okay then 
okay then the problem is finished 
mm-hm 
hello can I help you 
yes okay what I need to do is ship one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges and one tanker of orange juice to Bath 
all three commodities must be in Bath by noon it is now twelve midnight 
okay first I need to find out um I need to get an engine and a boxcar of bananas 
um okay I can take engine number two pick up a mm engine number one no I cannot do that 
alright engine number two pick up a boxcar go from Elmira to Corning to Dansville to Avon to pick up the bananas 
uh okay just a second 
and then go to Bath 
let me see now so that from engine E two taking a boxcar from Elmira to Corning 
mm-hm 
to Dansville to Avon 
mm-hm 
uh and picking up the bananas that would be accomplished at uh the bananas would be loaded at at seven am 
alright so 
and then you wanna go and then you wanna go to Bath from Avon 
what if I pick up 
that would be eleven am so that would that would be on time for that part 
okay um and now I need to get a boxcar of oranges 
um so I take engine number three 
pick up a boxcar in Elmira um pick up the oranges in Corning and go to Bath 
okay so that would be um that would be there we have plenty of time uh um by five am 
mm-hm 
okay and now you need orange juice still right 
right so I need to um get one of the tankers in Corning and go back to Elmira 
and then pick up the orange juice go back to Corning and then to Bath 
okay well which engine do you want to use to get the tanker car 
oh whoops 
okay I guess I going to have to go bring the engine from Avon to Dansville to Corning 
um well that the one with the bananas I mean that taking the bananas 
oh is it 
so then I have I still have one available over 
uh 
let me see 
no no you right I sorry that was engine two that was going over there 
so I 
so engine one is still over in in in Avon 
mm-hm 
so do I have enough time to do all this get it from engine one from Avon to Dansville to Corning 
pick up the tanker go to Elmira get the orange juice and then return to Corning and then to Bath 
well let see first we gotta make sure not to run into the other engine 
right 
that coming the other way but just on time alone that would be four hours to Corning um another two hours to Elmira would be six hours 
um and um let see oh wait um 
we also need to get the oranges to Elmira did you have that part 
yes uh-huh 
so can we go over that part again 
alright maybe we should switch the engines then 
okay 
and take engine number one from Avon to pick up the boxcar in Dansville 
mm-hm 
pick up the oranges in Corning and then go to Bath 
okay so that would be um 
that way we 
yeah that would 
that way we would have the we would have engine I cannot remember either two or three that we used for the whatever one we didnot use for the bananas and used it for the orange juice 
mm-hm 
okay uh let see so then we were using uh engine three for the oranges 
mm 
and um 
no we gonna- we gonna switch it to engine one 
right well no okay oh engine one for the oranges so engine two 
mm-hm 
for the bananas 
uh still for the bananas and so engine three now for the orange juice 
so let see um let go let work out the orange juice part again so that would be engine three starting from Elmira 
okay 
mm-hm 
and then we gonna go to Corning and pick up a tanker and load it with orange juice I sorry and then we have to go back to Elmira to get the orange juice 
okay um 
and then return to Corning and then to Bath 
alright so let see um that will work with time I wondering if we gonna have these trains running into each other though 
crash 
so um let me see now um 
well the one for the banana we just having the engine go from Elmira to and taking the boxcar going to Corning 
mm-hm 
and then to mm we could either go to Bath or we could go to Dansville we should probably go to Bath first 
go to Dansville pick up I sorry go to Avon pick up the bananas and then come back to Bath 
that way the other one can be free the orange juice one can be freely travel back and forth to Corning 
mm-hm um right 
um let see let uh try and work this out so engine engine one starts out at Avon 
mm-hm 
mm-hm 
and it going um to Dansville 
mm-hm 
is that right 
yeah 
and then 
to pick up the boxcar 
pick up a boxcar and then goes to Corning 
and picks up orange 
mm-hm 
and then goes to Bath 
mm-hm 
okay uh and that will take a total of um let see total of of seven hours 
okay 
and we using that that path from Avon to Bath there 
engine two was going to do the bananas 
mm-hm 
so it was starting at Elmira and picking up a boxcar is that right 
yes 
uh goes to Corning and then uh 
can I use 
actually you could go to Dansville that is that the way you wanted to go yeah that uh they would both be in Dansville at the same time 
but then they go the opposite way 
so 
right so I think they could I think it okay for them to cross as long as it at a city um 
can I use several boxcars for with one engine 
yes 
so we could done this completely differently 
yes 
easily 
okay so what if we use engine number one 
uh-huh- so you want to you want to change the plan 
I donot know 
well let work out what we have so far and see if we want to change 
alright 
okay so engine two is getting a boxcar going to Corning um and then going to Dansville 
mm-hm 
and then going to Avon um and then going to- picking up bananas 
mm-hm 
and then going to um Bath 
um okay so that that the longest part that takes eleven hours 
um and now engine three 
mm-hm 
is uh see it going from Elmira to Corning 
mm-hm 
uh and picking picking up a tanker car 
mm-hm 
going back to Elmira no wait uh we we need to get oranges to Elmira 
so we we need a uh boxcar to take oranges 
mm-hm we can get a boxcar at Elmira though 
okay so it starting out with a boxcar 
uh going to Corning loading oranges and picking up a tanker 
uh going back to Elmira uh 
making the orange juice and then going to Corning and then to Bath 
mm-hm 
okay so that nine hours and let see if there any conflicts here 
um so it the engine two and three we want uh they would uh we would want them both to start out at the same time um 
and um let see uh 
think if we delay engine three for an hour then then we fine um

okay 
so that that it 
I now finished 
hello can I help you 
yes um my warm up problem is I need to design a plan for shipping a boxcar of oranges to Bath by eight am today and the time now is midnight 
okay 
the orange warehouse where I need the oranges from is in Corning 
right 
so I need is it possible for one of the engines would it be faster for an engine to come from Elmira or Avon 
uh Elmira is a lot closer 
what time would engine two and three leave Elmira 
um well they not scheduled yet but we can send them at any time we want 
okay 
uh so if we sent them right away it get there at at um at two am 
at Corning 
yeah 
and how long would it take to get from Corning to Bath 
uh two hours 
how long would it take to load the oranges from the warehouse into the engine 
uh well we cannot load oranges into an engine we need a boxcar 
mm-hm 
to load them into 
so can I dispatch an engine and a boxcar from Elmira simultaneously to Corning 
uh yeah yeah we can uh connect an engine to the boxcar and then take have the engine take the boxcar to Corning 
so it be two hours to Corning 
right 
and then do I have to take in um loading time into consideration 
yeah it takes an hour to load the oranges 
so there three hours so we to three am 
right 
and then two hours to Bath 
right 
so shall we do that 
yes 
okay 
so I think we done 
okay 
hello can I help you 
yes I have to ship two boxcars of bananas and two boxcars of oranges to Dansville 
all cargo must arrive by ten am 
okay 
can two boxcars be hooked to one engine 
yes 
how long will it take for the two engines and two boxcars to get to Corning 
alright um wait there only one track 
right 
so they have to follow each other um 
okay 
so I guess uh they could both be there in three hours 
how do you do you want to hook up the engines to the boxcars 
yes 
uh so one to each 
yes 
okay 
alright and 
so send one they both go to Corning 
okay 
and engine two the two boxcars will be loaded up with oranges 
okay um we could we could attach both boxcars to one engine if you like 
okay yes 
okay so uh engine E two 
yeah 
okay 
okay with boxcars and send that to Corning 
okay 
then engine three also send that to Corning 
okay 
so that would that take a total of three hours 
uh yeah engine E three will be there at uh in three hours uh do you want to load the oranges into the boxcars 
yes 
okay so that take another two hours to load the the boxcars 
okay 
uh so now what 
how long will it take to send engine three to Bath 
um another two hours so that would be five am 
when it would get to Bath 
okay how about to Dansville 
uh one hour from Corning 
so that would take me up to six 
uh yes well um 
well for engine 
which engine are we are we taking 
for okay engine two is at Corning 
right 
and that took 
that took four hours well including loading loading the oranges 
four hours 
okay 
so an extra hour to Dansville 
uh right 
so it take three hours for engine three to get from Elmira to Corning 
right 
and then take an additional hour so we each at four hours 
um 
so it been 
let see 
well four hours would have the the engine E two still at Corning but loaded up and E three could be at Dansville 
engine three at Dansville 
okay um 
can I attach two boxcars from Dansville to engine three 
yeah 
and how long would it take to get to the Avon 
uh three hours 
okay three more hour and to load up 
another hour oh well three boxcars 
how how 
two it just has two 
two 
okay 
uh two hours to load up um two boxcars 
so it two hours there and two hours to load up 
uh three hours to get to Avon and two hours to load up 
um so and then you like to send them back to Dansville 
yeah that will put me an hour over for the bananas 
okay well um we could use engine E one 
right 
and I need the boxcar 
right well we can still use the boxcars at Dansville 
uh Avon is closer to Dansville than 
Elmira 
well or we could send engine E three I mean start it before the one with the boxcars I mean would would because the oranges are getting there in plenty of time 
okay 
so if we start it before is that is that will that change the time 
um yes so then we would get to Dansville at three am 
okay so it take three hours to get Dansville 
um 
let see we still still got a problem here I think um 
um 
it should be another oh oh I see it uh I it only takes one hour to load um any number of boxcars 
oh so total 
yeah 
okay 
so maybe that would work because we were only off by an hour 
right 
so for engine two 
okay 
two boxcars attached it takes how long to get to Corning 
two hours 
two hours plus an hour loading 
right 
three hours and that goes to Dansville so that there on time 
right 
engine three travels from Elmira to Corning in two hours 
two hours right 
an hour to Dansville 
right 
and then to load up two boxcars 
um what 
just to hook them up 
oh to connect them doesnot take any time 
okay so there three hours two hours to Avon 
uh three hours to Avon 
Avon there six 
an hour to load 
right 
and then back to Dansville 
three more hours 
right there ten 
okay so um but we have to send E three then ahead of engine two 
right right 
okay 
okay so we send engine E three uh to Corning 
mm-hm 
and then to Dansville pick up two boxcars 
right 
take them to Avon load bananas 
mm-hm 
and take them back to Dansville 
mm-hm 
and then starting an hour later we gonna take engine two with the two boxcars loaded at Elmira 
mm-hm 
send it to Corning load oranges and then on to Dansville 
right 
okay so that solves the problem 
yep okay 
hello can I help you

okay yeah um let see I got to transport one tanker of OJ to Avon and a boxcar of bananas to Corning by three pm 
okay 
where do the bananas go 
uh to Corning 
okay 
alright um I guess um how far is it from Avon to Dansville 
uh three hours 
okay and from how about from Avon to Bath 
four hours 
four hours okay um 
I guess I gotta let see here alright um uh I want to take uh engine two from Elmira 
to uh to Dansville to pick up a boxcar 
okay 
via Corning 
via Corning yeah 
mm-hm 
so what that three hours 
yes 
okay and then another three hours to Avon is that right 
right 
okay so that six hours that where I could load up the bananas 
right 
which would take how long an hour 
right 
okay so that seven hours 
and we have a total of fifteen hours so and then take it back through Dansville to Corning to drop them off 
okay uh 
will that work 
so that will get us there at eleven am 
okay and it gotta be there by three 
right 
we all set okay and we got to get a tanker of OJ to Avon 
um okay I guess I could use engine three 
okay 
um pick up uh a tanker in Corning um I guess how long is it from Elmira to Corning 
uh two hours 
okay so I gotta go there to get the tanker and then come back to fill it up 
right 
okay so it gonna be five hours 
um 
all together two there one filling it up and two back 
well we need to make uh orange juice first there none already made 
okay the OJ so you gotta come back to the OJ factory is that 
well we need we need to take oranges to the OJ factory 
oh you gotta pick up 
oh okay um what one boxcar is that 
uh right 
does one boxcar fill one tanker okay 
yes 
okay so you gotta take the engine okay engine three with the boxcar 
mm-hm 
to Corning um takes an hour to load up the oranges 
right 
okay so that three hours and two hours back to the OJ factory 
mm-hm 
oh wait okay hold on um can can an engine carry a boxcar and a tanker 
uh yes 
okay can okay so I guess alright start in Elmira then with 
mm-hm 
engine three and a boxcar 
right 
go to Corning 
uh-huh 
fill up the boxcar with the oranges 
okay 
and pick up a tanker bring it back to Elmira 
uh-huh 
okay 
and make the OJ right 
mm-hm 
and then fill up the tanker 
uh-huh 
and then go to uh from Elmira to Avon via Corning and Dansville 
okay uh we have to make sure not to run into the other train 
oh okay 
uh 
uh okay so let me 
so 
okay the the bananas are going to Corning by three 
right the um 
okay 
okay what the original I do you have the original route of the bananas 
the bananas we were gonna take engine E two 
okay 
go from Elmira to Corning to Dansville 
okay 
pick up a boxcar go to Avon pick up bananas and uh and um back um 
back to Corning 
back to Corning by Dansville 
via Dansville 
okay 
right 
alright well we could go well we have time to spare right so we could probably go back to Corning via Bath 
um that would take an extra two hours so that would be one pm 
okay 
alright so we still make it there on time 
right 
and then the other tracks would be open for us to bring the tanker of OJ 
right um the only problem is that um you cannot have both engine two and engine three leaving Elmira at the same time 
oh okay 
so one would have to be delayed by an hour 
okay um alright well how about if we use how about if we use engine one instead then and go to pick up a boxcar in Dansville 
and then bring it back to Avon for to fill it up with bananas 
mm-hm 
and then go via Bath back to Corning 
Dansville to Avon is how long 
okay 
um 
four 
three uh three hours 
three 
okay so it takes six to go back and forth an hour to fill up would be seven 
and then what was it like another six hours to Corning via Bath 
right 
alright so we have enough time 
right that would be one clock 
if I use engine one okay 
and then can I use the other one the my original plan for uh for the the tanker of OJ with engine two 
with engine two instead of engine three 
right 
okay so engine two will 
so engine three would get used 
okay engine two will pick up a boxcar 
drive to Corning and get the oranges and a tanker 
right 
then back to the OJ factory to make it 
okay just a second um 
uh-uh 
okay back to Elmira 
right to make the OJ and then go back to Avon via Corning and Dansville 
uh-huh 
um 
so there should be any overlap of the tracks 
right so that would get there at two pm 
okay um 
so 
I is the problem solved then 
uh yes 
okay I finished 
okay 
uh there five boxcars of orange waiting for me at Corning 
um I have to make a tanker of OJ and then deliver the tanker plus the four boxcars of oranges to Bath as soon as possible 
um let go over that again so the five boxcars of oranges that are at 
at at Corning 
um 
okay the orange warehouse um I have to 
you need you need to get five boxcars of oranges there 
uh no they already waiting for me there 
um 
so I have to pick them up and I have to make one 
I donot see them on my map 
uh that what it says in the problem it says there are five boxcars of oranges waiting for you at Corning 
hm 
um well I cannot find them 
okay 
we can 
okay 
oh uh hello can I help you 
uh-huh okay sure um okay I gotta determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that I can get to Bath by seven am tomorrow morning okay 
Bath by seven am 
yeah alright um I guess the first thing I do is take engine two and the two boxcars from Elmira 
mm-hm 
um go to Corning two hours 
right 
okay um from go to Dansville to pick up the other three boxcars which would be 
okay 
um hm I donot know if the okay that be three hours right I have five box- 
oh let see um right 
does it take any time to hook up the boxcars 
uh no 
okay so I have five boxcars in Dansville after at three am okay so I drive an hour back to Corning 
okay 
um which would make it what four am 
right 
with five boxcars an hour to fill up this does it still take the same amount of time with five box- 
right 
okay 
so that would bring us to five am and then two hours to Bath 
okay 
that give us 
uh there a problem that uh an engine can only pull three loaded boxcars at a time 
oh it can only pull three loaded boxcars 
yeah and any number of unloaded boxcars 
okay 
so when you made the orange juice at Corning you would uh be able to um pull all of them out 
okay well 
okay when I filled them up at Corning I could send engine three from Elmira to Corning at that point cause the track would be clear right 
right 
and it could pick up the other two boxcars 
mm-hm 
that are full that engine two couldnot take 
right 
um but then they both couldnot go to Bath could they 
um not at the same time 
okay okay I see alright I know what I gotta do 
alright so uh alright I gonna have engine two go through then and pick up the um the boxcars in Dansville 
okay 
like we planned on doing except he not gonna take the original two boxcars 
okay 
and after he leaves then engine three can take the two boxcars that are at Elmira 
right 
and fill them up at Corning 
uh-huh 
and take take them to Bath 
okay so engine two will have to leave an hour after I mean engine three will have to leave an hour after engine two then 
yeah correct 
okay 
okay so but engine three would still be able to make it to Bath because he not going through Dansville 
right 
okay so they would both be taken care of and then uh 
so engine two is going uh to Corning to Dansville pick up three boxcars and back to Corning 
right to fill up 
right and meanwhile engine three leaves an hour later gets to Corning the same time that engine two gets to Dansville 
right 
so engine three loads the 
and leaves Corning while the other one getting back to Corning 
so it so it loads the oranges while the while engine two is getting to Corning and then it goes on to Bath um while engine two is loading 
is is loading right 
okay and then engine two follows 
okay 
alright 
and I donot believe that in the seven hours we can fit engine one into the equation here without running over the same tracks 
uh 
or maybe if 
well from engine one the the quickest way to Corning yeah that would be four hours already 
be at Dansville 
right so that not gonna be possible 
um 
to pick up pick up boxcars fill them and bring them back so we cannot 
the only other boxcars are at Bath 
right 
and that that too far 
yeah okay so we all done 
um 
is that right or 
well I just wondering 
I donot think there any way to incorporate those other two boxcars is there 
I wondering if we take engine one have engine one take the boxcars at Dansville 
from Dansville 
and um try to send engine two to Bath 
um 
uh 
okay well engine one it four hours from Avon to Dansville 
uh yeah 
and then 
well three hours from Avon to Dansville 
okay three hours and then an hour to Corning so that four 
right 
an hour to fill up is five okay and two hours to Bath is seven 
right 
okay so we could do that 
okay 
now the question is whether can engine two to Corning would be two hours then to Bath would be four hours picking up the boxcar and back would be six no there no way to 
no I donot think I think 
to go back to Bath 
yes 
no I think five boxcars is the top 
right 
okay 
alright so I think we done 
okay we finished 
hello can I help you 
um yeah um 
you need to design a plan for shipping a boxcar of oranges to Bath by eight am today 
the time now is twelve midnight 
okay 
um the oranges are at Corning 
right 
um so how would you like to send them to Bath 
um I guess uh by by train 
right okay well we need to put oranges in a boxcar and we need an engine to carry the boxcar 
so um we need one of the three engines and we need to bring that to Corning with a boxcar 
right 
pick up the oranges and then proceed to Bath 
right 
um how I imagine there a well there a boxcar at Dansville which is probably the closest to Corning 
um and then there an engine at Elmira 
right so there are actually two engines at Elmira 
right 
which one would you like to use 
number three 
okay 
might as well just take a boxcar from there as well from Elmira 
okay 
so we connect a boxcar to E three 
at Elmira 
right 
and go to Corning 
okay 
and there I guess we pick up some oranges 
okay 
and then go to Bath 
alright so that will get us to Bath at uh five am so plenty of time 
right 
hello can I help you 
yeah I need to ship one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges one tanker of OJ to Bath 
all three commodities must be in Bath by noon and it is now twelve midnight 
okay 
okay let see 
there two boxcars available at Elmira 
right 
so I I use those um no I would 
um okay let me think this out bananas are at Avon 
um okay let me think this out bananas are at Avon 
the oranges are at Corning 
um and the tanker of OJ I would imagine from the OJ factory at Elmira 
right we donot have any orange juice currently at Elmira so we need to make some 
okay so we have to take oranges from Corning and bring them to Elmira 
right 
and then back to Bath by 
by noon 
by noon okay so we have twelve hours to do all this 
right 
okay um 
let see well um I guess start with use engine three from Elmira 
okay 
and proceed to Corning 
okay 
where pick up um one of the tankers there with uh oranges that will be used 
mm-hm 
for the 
okay to move the oranges we need a boxcar 
okay we bring a boxcar from Elmira with the engine three 
okay 
um so we get to Corning with the engine three and the boxcar will get to Corning 
and we pick up uh can a tanker and a boxcar be pulled by an engine 
yes 
so okay so we pick up a tank of uh the tanker of OJ oranges 
right 
and bring it to Elmira 
okay 
to make uh the OJ um 
okay 
let see 
so we got a tanker of OJ at Elmira with a boxcar and engine three it gone to Corning and back 
um it gone to Corning and back right 
it gone Corning get the oranges and back 
right 
to make to make the orange juice 
right and the tankers so do you want to make the orange juice 
yes 
okay um so we have orange juice ready at uh seven am 
okay so we have five hours to get it back to Bath is that is that right 
right 
okay hm 
and then it was seven am it at at Elmira 
right 
okay 
can you get to Elmira and to Bath in five hours 
uh yes it takes four hours from Elmira to Bath 
okay 
uh but we need an extra hour to load the oranges back into the tanker car 
so it get there right at noon 
right 
okay is is that acceptable by noon 
so 
yes 
alright okay 
alright so that okay but now we need a boxcar of bananas and a boxcar of oranges as well 
right 
um the bananas are at Avon 
with the banana house er the banana warehouse being at Avon with engine one 
yes 
um can you do I need a boxcar to bring the bananas 
yes you do 
uh uh 
how about if I take engine two from Elmira 
uh-huh 
with there one extra boxcar there now 
yes we took one boxcar with engine three so there another boxcar there 
right 
so I go from Elmira how far is it how long will it take from Elmira to Avon via Dansville 
uh six hours 
okay so if I take an engine engine two and a boxcar from Elmira go to Corning 
get a boxcar of oranges and then go to Avon 
stopping in Dansville for another boxcar 
uh-huh 
is it 
okay 
can I take two boxcars with one engine 
yes 
okay so yeah take engine two and a boxcar from Elmira 
mm-hm 
and go to Corning pick up one boxcar pick up uh oranges for that one boxcar it has 
uh-huh 
and then go to Dansville 
and pick up another boxcar 
okay 
uh-huh 
and then go to Avon 
uh-huh 
and fill that boxcar with bananas 
mm-hm 
what how much time is that 
so let see um 
that eight hours after the bananas have been loaded 
okay and then then from Avon I go with the two commodities that I have 
right 
I go to Bath 
okay 
will that be there by noon 
yes 
okay 
so I I I will do that that and at the ooh wait only one train can go let me think 
yes the the problem here is that E two and E three are both want to leave Elmira at the same time 
yeah 
right 
um so one would have to be delayed by an hour 
um the the E two what if that was delayed by an hour would that still make it to Bath 
um E two is the one going to Avon 
right 
right that would put it at Bath at one pm so that too late 
so that would work 
okay engine one is at Avon which hasnot been used 
right 
um 
if I take the engine one from Avon and go to Dansville to get a boxcar 
okay 
with bananas 
how about if I go from Avon yeah I take engine one and go to Dansville 
mm-hm 
get two boxcars 
then I go to Corning and pick up the oranges 
okay 
and then I go back to Avon 
via Dansville 
right 
well how well how long would it take from Corning to Avon compared to Corning via Dansville compared via Bath 
takes four hours via Dansville and six hours via Bath 
okay so I want to use Dansville 
um 
yeah if I if I take engine one from Avon and go to Corning via Dansville stopping in Dansville to get two boxcars 
uh-huh 
pick up oranges at Corning 
mm-hm 
then I go back to Avon 
okay 
and pick up the bananas 
okay that would be uh ten am when you loaded with bananas at Avon 
and how long does it take to get to Bath from there 
four hours 
oh so that would work either 
um hm 
um let see 
um 
hm 
well you could um you could uh take the oranges with the orange juice 
if you if you didnot go with engine E one over to to Corning 
mm-hm 
to get the oranges 
it takes an extra three hours to go from Dansville to Corning pick up oranges and back to Dansville 
mm-hm 
so if you had engine E one just do the just take the bananas I think you could make it 
um I didnot follow that 
okay um if we have engine E one go to Dansville 
pick up a boxcar go back to Avon load the bananas and go to Bath 
that would make it there at uh eleven clock 
okay so that would leave only two more things to be delivered 
right well the the orange juice you already have uh getting there on time with engine E three 
oh okay so now all I need was the uh oranges 
right 
um 
yeah what if alright E three if I E three what did we say it it goes to it goes to 
so E three um picks up a boxcar goes to Corning 
mm-hm 
picks up uh a tanker car 
mm-hm 
loads oranges into the boxcar goes back to Elmira makes orange juice 
and loads it back loads the orange juice into the tanker 
um then goes to Corning and to Bath 
okay what if 
and gets there at noon 
what if it stop- oh it gets there at noon 
right 
I I was gonna say if it could stop in Corning again and pick up the oranges but it would get there in time 
right 
uh 
well it will be in in Corning at at the beginning of the plan 
if you take an extra boxcar uh uh instead of just loading one taking one boxcar and loading it with oranges 
uh if you take two boxcars and load them both with oranges 
mm-hm 
at the beginning that would take any longer 
okay so that what I do 
okay so let recap this 
okay 
uh engine E three is going to pick up two boxcars 
mm-hm 
go to Corning 
mm-hm 
uh pick up a tanker and load oranges into the two boxcars 
mm-hm 
uh go to Elmira 
right 
um unload one of the boxcars and make orange juice 
right 
and load the orange juice into the tanker 
right 
then go uh back and go to Bath back through Corning 
right 
getting there at noon 
right 
engine one is going from Dansville from Avon 
mm-hm 
uh to Dansville 
right 
uh picking up a boxcar uh going back to Avon 
right 
loading bananas 
uh-huh 
and then going to Bath 
right 
uh getting in at eleven 
okay I now now finished 
right 
okay 
hello can I help you 
yes I like to take a tanker from Corning and bring it to Elmira 
alright 
and from Elmira I like to load orange juice into the tanker 
mm-hm 
I like then to take the the tanker back from Elmira to Corning 
alright 
now from Corning what would be the quickest route to Avon 
uh through Dansville 
okay then I like to take the tanker of orange juice through Dansville and then on to Avon 
alright um which engine would you like to use 
engine E two 
alright 
well is is E two which is a will either one take me there any quicker 
uh no they a they both the same 
okay then I take engine E two 
alright 
and the tankers move at the same speed 
right 
okay 
so uh the plan is to take engine E two to Corning pick up a tanker back to Elmira 
um load it with orange juice and then to Avon 
by way of Corning and Dansville 
by way of 
right 
how long will that take 
eleven hours 
okay I am now finished 
hello can I help you 
how long does it take for a box car to get from Dansville to Corning 
uh one hour 
okay I like to take two boxcars um and how long does it take to get a boxcar from Bath to Corning 
two hours 
and how long does it take to load oranges 
one hour one hour per boxcar 
per boxcar 
and how long does it take to go from Corning to Dansville 
no I sorry it takes one hour to load any number of boxcars I sorry what was the next question 
to go from Corning to Dansville with two boxcars of oranges how does the long does that take 
one hour 
alright I like to have two boxcars leave Bath 
mm-hm 
pick up oranges in Corning 
mm-hm 
and move on to Dansville 
okay you need an engine 
how many engines will I need for each of those 
uh you just need one engine to pull the boxcars 
alright so at midnight I like for the can the boxcars need an engine to move anywhere 
right 
okay how long does it take to get an engine from Avon to Bath 
four hours 
and to load the boxcars on does that take time 
no uh to to couple to the boxcars is is instantaneous 
okay so if I were to move to Avon to Bath that would take me till four am 
right 
from Bath to Corning will take me to six am 
right 
loading the oranges will take me to seven am 
right 
and moving to Dansville will take me to eight am 
that right 
so I like engine E one to leave Avon 
alright 
go to Bath and pick up two boxcars 
mm-hm 
go to Corning and pick up oranges 
mm-hm 
and then move on to Dansville 
alright 
okay now at the same time I like for two boxcars to leave for an engine how long does it take to get from Avon to Dansville 
uh three hours 
and how long does it take to load bananas 
one hour 
okay I like for an engine to leave Avon 
uh the the engine from Avon is already leaving to go to Bath 
did uh I use the 
how long does it take from to get from Elmira to Corning 
two hours 
and from Corning to Dansville 
one hour 
I like engine E two to go from Elmira to Corning from Corning to Dansville and pick up two boxcars 
mm-hm 
then go to from Dansville to Avon 
alright 
load the two boxcars with bananas 
alright 
and then move back to Dansville 
alright 
how long will that all take 
ten hours 
okay I like to do both of those things 
alright 
and they now finished 
hello can I help you 
um when I what do you mean when it says make into two tankers of OJ what does that mean 
uh that means uh that the oranges I imagine that you that it will be arriving at uh the orange juice factory will be converted into orange juice 
um it takes one hour to make orange juice from any amount of oranges 
so 
okay so I gonna need to get the oranges to to the orange juice factory 
right 
and then get the orange juice to Avon 
alright 
okay now I gonna get I gonna take engine E two from Elmira 
okay 
and go to Corning which should take two hours 
right 
in Corning I like to load I I when I bring engine E two I also like to bring over the two boxcars which are in Elmira 
okay 
I gonna bring them to Corning 
uh-huh 
engine E two and two boxcars 
uh-huh 
at Corning I load the boxcars up with oranges 
uh-huh 
that take one hour 
right 
so now it three am 
right 
gonna take the engine and the two boxcars of oranges to Elmira 
to five am 
alright 
I gonna now in when I in Corning 
mm-hm 
now that I have an engine and two boxcars there 
mm-hm 
I also like to bring two tankers back to Elmira with me when I bring the oranges 
you can only carry uh each engine can only pull three cars 
okay each engine can only pull three cars 
that the maximum that right 
okay 
I like okay let me think now we gonna we gonna go from take engine E two from Elmira 
alright 
we gonna bring two boxcars to Corning 
alright 
we going to leave we gonna load oranges 
okay now from Corning we gonna get one take one boxcar and one tanker 
mm-hm 
each engine can pull how many cars 
three 
three 
alright so from Corning I gonna take one engine I gonna have the engine coming back with me 
uh back where 
to Elmira 
back to Elmira 
okay 
and it gonna be pulling now two tankers 
okay 
and one boxcar 
okay 
and back back to Elmira 
okay 
now I wanna leave the two tankers in Elmira 
okay 
go back to Corning 
okay 
pick up my pick up my second tanker 
okay 
now how many how many oranges boxcars of oranges does that leave in Elmira 
just one 
okay so now from Corning I gonna bring back with me my second tanker and my second boxcar of oranges 
and a third tanker yeah okay 
I how many tankers do I have in Elmira now 
you have two tankers you have two tankers in Elmira 
okay so I just gonna bring back one boxcar of oranges 
okay that all you need you only need one tanker 
right I gonna I uh I gonna need two tankers of orange juice 
alright 
but I have two tankers in in Elmira now I just brought them over 
right 
so now I I have one boxcar of oranges sitting in Elmira 
so on my second trip back with the engine I wanna bring back another boxcar to Elmira full of oranges 
okay you could save an hour by leaving the boxcars to be loaded while you bringing the tank cars back to Elmira 
okay uh then I like to do that 
okay 
so now what time is it when I have everything I need in Elmira 
uh in 
when I in Elmira 
okay right just a sec 
after the orange juice is made 
uh it nine am 
it sorry what time 
nine am uh wait a second uh also loading the the let see let me see it gonna take an hour to unload should be noon 
noon 
is it 
yeah it take an hour to unload the oranges an hour to make the orange juice and an hour to load the tanker 
okay can you think of a quicker way for me to accomplish this by one pm 
um 
yes you could send the engine from Avon to Corning it take it four hours to get there 
uh the engine at Elmira take two boxcars to Corning 
um so four hours later picks up the two tankers and goes to Elmira 
four hours later so it takes six hours to get the oranges to Elmira and the tankers and all three engines 
okay 
so that would be six am 
alright and now how what time will it be 
okay so then it take then it take three hours so it be nine am 
can I get from Elmira to Avon in four hours 
no 
okay 
then what I wanna do is have engine E two and E three and the two boxcars go from Elmira to Corning 
okay 
I like to then return from Corning to Elmira with both engines two boxcars of oranges and two tankers 
okay it takes an hour to load so that five hours 
and I back in Elmira with my boxcars and my tankers 
right 
so in three hours I can have orange juice 
right so that 
all loaded up and ready to go 
that right 
so it eight clock in Elmira 
right 
can I get from Elmira to Avon in five hours 
no 
can you think of a better way to do this 
no that looks about as quick as you can get 
can you conceive of any way to get to accomplish this task by one pm 
no it seems like the uh earliest you can get it done is two pm 
uh with uh out any exception 
I donot see any other way to do it uh the closest oranges are Corning 
okay 
so we necessarily we have to go from Elmira to Avon we have to go take the orange juice from Elmira to Avon 
uh-huh 
and that gonna take us five hours no matter what 
that right 
and we have to spend three hours in Elmira 
well that actually that gonna take six hours no matter what 
six hours no matter what 
right 
and we have to spend three hours in Elmira before that unloading and loading right 
right 
so from getting to Elmira with the oranges to Avon takes nine hours at the minimum 
right 
so in order to accomplish this task we need to get the oranges to Elmira in four hours 
mm-hm 
to get to get any engine to get anything on any engine to Corning to Elmira takes at least four hours 
that right 
so that that takes our thirteen hours right there 
right 
and we havenot accounted for loading up the oranges 
that right 
so it doesnot seem as though there a way to complete this task do you agree 
uh no it doesnot 
okay I now finished 
hello can I help you 
yes I would like to take an engine take engine two from Elmira 
mm-hm 
and bring it to Corning 
okay 
with a boxcar 
alright 
I then like to take I then like to load oranges I like to fill the boxcar with oranges as well as attach a tanker to my engine 
okay 
I then like to bring the tanker the engine and the boxcar back to Elmira 
okay 
where by we make orange juice 
okay 
and bring and then bring that orange juice from Elmira to Avon via Dansville 
which should take us until two clock 
okay uh 
is that w- is that correct that that can be completed by two clock 
uh I get I get noon 
um 
no I sorry um you right two clock

four hours 
okay 
so I like to take engine E one from Avon to Bath 
mm-hm 
and pick up a boxcar 
mm-hm 
I then like to bring it back to Avon and load bananas 
okay 
and then I like to take that take that engine and boxcar and bananas to Corning via Dansville 
sorry uh to Corning by Dansville 
right which should take four hours 
four hours that right 
so what the total elapsed time of the second 
one clock 
and the other one will be finished by two 
that right 
okay I like to do both of those simultaneously starting at midnight 
alright 
and I now finished 
hello can I help you 
okay um 
I want to know how long alright how long does it take to get one engine and one boxcar from Elmira to Corning and also the same for one engine from Avon to Dansville 
okay from um Elmira to Corning it takes two hours 
okay 
and from Avon to where did you say 
to Dansville 
it takes three hours 
okay um how long does it take to get from Corning to Dansville 
Corning to Dansville takes one hour 
okay uh only one train can be on the track at one time 
right exactly 
even if they heading both in the same direction 
um just as long as there like some like time in between them 
okay um hm 
uh can more than one boxcar be put on an engine 
yeah 
okay 
so there can be at most three boxcars on an engine or like tanker cars 
okay 
well first of all I like to start off by sending uh the engine E one from Avon to Dansville 
okay E one from Avon to Dansville okay 
um hm next uh hm okay I like to send uh does it take any less time if it just an engine 
no it still takes three hours 
okay um 
yep they have to go the same speed 
okay 
could I move one engine with two boxcars engine E two from Elmira to Corning 
yeah okay 
and then one hour later start the next engine from Elmira 
okay so um sure so then E three then at one am with um how many boxcars 
uh E three there only there are only two boxcars available 
okay 
okay so then E two will like take both boxcars then 
right 
okay 
to Corning 
okay 
and 
how long is would how long does it take to fill up two boxcars 
it will take um one hour 
okay 
hm 
okay um what time would it be once the I guess engine E two arrives at Corning with the two boxcars 
it would be two 
two clock 
yep it be two clock 
and by the time it loads it would be three clock 
three clock right 
okay um 
hm 
and at three clock also the engine E one would be at Dansville correct 
right 
okay um how long does it take to get from Bath to Avon 
from Bath to Avon takes four hours 
and then Avon to Dansville is two 
Avon to Dansville is three hours 
hm alright that not gonna work um 
let see here so the current state is at three clock there is one uh engine with two boxcars at Corning 
right 
and 
loaded up 
loaded and one engine and three boxcars at Dansville right 
yep 
right 
okay 
with an engine E one there 
okay and so and there three boxcars in Dansville 
right 
uh so um hm can we move the first of all I like to send the engine with the uh two boxcars full from the orange warehouse to Bath 
yep 
yep okay 
hm how this gonna work 
do I get time to think 
sure 
okay 
is it possible to start over 
um no 
no okay 
so um so what are you trying to um do exactly 
okay well um 
I guess I started off with the uh engine from E one that was at Avon 
yep 
moving to Dansville which had three boxcars 
right 
yep 
and then I was gonna move that to Corning 
yep okay 
and 
so we should be in Corning then with those three boxcars at four am 
right 
okay 
the thing is there two boxcars available at Bath that are sitting unused 
right right 
so 
so we so at like um three am we have engine E three in Corning so it get to Bath at five am 
mm-hm 
so did you want to do that 
okay yeah 
okay so Corning will be there at three am and on to Bath so that be in Bath at five am 
right 
good 
okay and then we gonna pick up those two boxcars 
and 
right 
okay 
and it takes an hour to get back to Corning 
it takes an hour to get from Bath from from where 
right 
from Bath to Corning 
so 
okay that take two more hours so we we get back into Bath at seven am 
right that doesnot do any good wait you you get back to Bath with one of the 
oh sorry sorry we would get back to Corning 
right 
at seven am with the two boxcars loaded on E three 
hm 
okay uh 
so in as far as the other so as far as engine E one 
right there is there should be one there should be one engine uh at Corning right 
um engine E two is there 
right 
um anyway it gonna leave for Bath at three am so it get to Bath at five am 
what about the other engine from Elmira 
the other engine from the engine that the other engine from um Avon you mean or from Elmira 
from Elmira 
okay that engine would have left at one am right would get to Corning at three am would get to Bath at five am pick up the two boxcars and be back in Corning at seven am 
and then it would take another two hours to get back to Bath though 
right exactly and and we would also have to load up the oranges there right 
right so that no good 
so we would get there at ten am 
right um well at least could we send the uh three boxcars and the engine from Dansville to Corning 
yeah okay so that get to so that get to Corning at four am 
okay and I guess send that load that up and then send it to Bath I assume 
okay so 
that would be the best at this point 
okay so we would load it up at so it take an hour to load it up so at five am 
we can go to Bath so we would get there at seven am 
right 
okay so that would be a total five 
yep 
available at by eight am 
right 
correct 
yep 
okay uh I would assume that that was that would be the best of the current situation 
so um what are you trying to do exactly 
okay 
what your um goal 
uh okay determine the maximum number of boxcars of oranges that you could get to Bath by seven am tomorrow morning 
oh okay see one other option is is that um I wondering if we took engine E one as and have it pick up the two boxcars at Bath 
yeah that what I thought of afterwords but I said move it Dansville 
and then go to Corning 
yeah but the thing is is that that would work because it takes six hours to go from Avon to Corning 
right 
and then so yeah I think five is about the most that we get 
right 
okay good so we done 
okay 
hello can I help you 
uh yes okay um 
hm 
okay uh I assume that it still takes the same amount of time as the last one 
right exactly 
hm and it takes two hours from Elmira to Corning correct 
two hours from yep 
uh hm well then in which case I do not think this problem is solvable 
so what are you trying to do 
uh says transport uh alright well first of all what time is it 
it um midnight 
okay yeah it says transport four boxcars of oranges to Bath by two pm oh two pm I thought it said two am 
two pm right so you got lots of time 
cannot read today 
okay um okay well in which case could I move the engine at E one to Dansville 
move the engine at Avon yeah E one to Dansville okay 
right 
so that take three hours 
and move uh engine two and two boxcars from Elmira to Corning 
okay so from Elmira to Corning so we get there at two am and you wanted to take both boxcars right 
right 
okay 
and once um that one arrives fill it up at Corning 
okay 
the engine E two with the two boxcars 
okay so that so that so we be done the loading at three am 
and then 
okay and that the time that that the one from Avon arrives at Dansville correct 
right 
and then at that time I like to take the engine E one with the three boxcars from Dansville and move it to Corning 
okay 
and move the engine with the two two filled boxcars uh at Corning to Bath 
okay let me just um think of where we at right now so it be four am once engine E one from Avon arrives in Corning with the three boxcars 
right 
okay 
um okay so that four am and then it be um it be three am by the time that E two is loaded with the two boxcars at Corning 
mm-hm 
so it be five am once it gets to Bath 
okay um what time will it be when the three boxcars and the engine from Dansville get to Corning 
okay it be four am 
okay and it would be five am by the time they are loaded 
yep 
okay and then move them after after moving them from Dansville to Corning and filling them up move them from Corning to Bath 
okay let me just um so that be seven am then 
okay by by the time everything gets to Bath 
um yep 
okay then I guess that the end of it 
okay so we got um five boxcars of oranges to Bath then 
mm-hm 
okay good 
hello can I help you 
right um 
the first question is how long would the uh would the engine from that at E one at Avon wait a second uh no that not gonna work 
alright how long does the engine at E one take to get to Dansville 
three hours 
okay and back is three hours 
yep 
and it takes one hour to load 
yep 
okay uh how long does it take to get from Avon to Bath 
um four hours 
okay um 
I guess what I like to do is take the engine at E one and move it to Dansville 
okay 
uh pick up the boxcars from there uh 
okay 
two that what it says so move two 
two boxcars okay 
two boxcars to Avon 
okay 
back to Avon again 
okay so that be six am 
fill them up 
with bananas 
right 
okay 
at the banana warehouse and that should be seven clock 
yep 
and then send them to Bath which should be three hours right 
four hours 
wait no that impossible wait 
hm let me think for a second 
hm it takes two hours from Elmira to Corning 
yep 
and one hour from Corning to Dansville 
one hour yep 
hm let me think here 
there are no boxcars at Avon right 
there no right 
hm 
hm 
so what exactly are you trying to do so your goal is 
okay well 
the goal is transport two boxcars of bananas from Corning or to Corning by eleven am 
okay 
at midnight um the only problem is there are no boxcars that are at Avon 
which is where the banana warehouse is so 
right right 
so it take us at least six hours to get boxcars 
one of the 
to get boxcars and go back and then an hour to fill up 
and then it would take you would get to Bath in time but you need an extra two hours to get to Corning or an extra hour to get to Corning 
okay 
so it takes us six hours to pick up the boxcars and go back to Avon 
right 
and then loading them up takes seven hours and then to get to Corning takes four more hours so that would be eleven hours 
wait to go from Avon to Dansville 
yep 
and Dansville back that that would be six clock right 
right 
yep 
so we load up the orange we load up the bananas 
and then loading up that would be seven clock 
yeah 
is it 
we then go to Dansville 
is it two or three hours to get to Dansville 
three hours and then one hour to get to Corning 
right so that would make it twelve clock would it 
um six plus one is seven ten eleven hours 
okay then I guess that what I like to do 
okay great good 
hello can I help you 
not yet okay four boxcars of oranges to Bath so 
um once again all the oranges are in Corning I assume 
right 
okay 
in in the orange juice in the orange factory 
okay um so I take two boxcars from Elmira to Corning 
two boxcars from Elmira so will you say engine E two then 
uh do they only need one engine for both of 
right exactly 
okay 
sure 
okay so that holds so two boxcars to Corning so that be two am 
and the other engine is gonna have to go actually both all everything at Elmira gonna have to go like both engines and both boxcars are gonna have to go to Corning 
okay 
and then um one of the engines will continue to Dansville 
okay 
and get two boxcars from there 
and come back to Corning 
okay so let me just figure out what time we get to so that get to Dansville at three 
two 
three 
and then back to Corning at four 
four 
okay so be four am and the other one will be there at two am 
okay 
okay and everything has to load up 
so that have 
okay so you want all three boxcars from Dansville 
no just two 
okay just two of them okay 
two boxcars from Dansville 
okay 
alright so now there four boxcars and two engines in Corning 
right 
they should all load up with oranges 
okay so that so that two am so E two will be loaded up by three am and E three will be loaded up by five am 
okay and then they go to Bath 
okay so that get there so E two will get there at five and the other one will get there at seven okay 
okay I finished 
hello can I help you 
yes okay um 
both boxcars and both engines should leave Elmira and go to Corning 
okay 
um the 
did you want the boxcars as well 
yes 
both boxcars and both engines 
okay 
okay 
should go to Corning 
okay 
and one engine should continue on to Dansville 
okay 
the other two boxcars should load up 
okay 
and go to Bath 
okay so that get us into Bath at five am with two boxcars of oranges 
okay then it five am alright so it not worth going back 
okay then the one engine that went to Dansville 
yep 
um should take all three boxcars from there 
okay 
and go to Corning 
okay yep so that get there at four into Corning 
and 
okay and load up 
that be five 
and then go to Bath

right um me see 
so we 
I have a question 
yep 
for three boxcars do you need uh engine E 
only one engine 
one engine 
yep 
okay 
so we get the engine from Avon 
okay 
and take it to Dansville 
okay 
and then we can get the boxcars from Dansville to Avon 
okay so it takes three hours to go from Avon to Dansville so we then pick up the boxcars and go back to Avon 
mm-hm 
so we get back to Avon at six am 
six am okay 
so we have three boxcars 
and then we fill the boxcars with bananas 
okay that takes an hour to load the boxcars so that be seven am 
okay and then we will take the bananas in the boxcars to Bath 
okay and that takes four hours to get to Bath 
mm-hm 
okay so it be eleven am is when we arrive in Bath 
okay now we have to get three tankers of orange juice to Bath 
okay 
um orange juice factory is in Elmira 
yep 
um 
three tankers are in Corning so we need to get the three tankers from Corning to Elmira 
right 
um then uh do we need engines for the tankers 
right yes we do 
okay 
so we just put engine E two 
yep 
for that fill the OJ into the three tankers 
okay but the thing is is that we first need to get oranges to the OJ factory 
oh okay 
and we need okay so 
so with the three tankers we just include the oranges in that 
okay but the thing is is that um oranges cannot go into tankers 
oh right 
they can only go into boxcars 
okay 
um how many uh tankers are equal to a boxcar 
about one to one yeah 
alright 
so we need to get a boxcar to to Elmira 
right 
um take one from Bath 
okay oh okay right okay 
um to Corning 
oh actually it would be quicker to um 
from Corning to Bath is two hours whereas from Corning to Dansville is like one hour 
okay 
so 
so we could pick up a boxcar there 
alright so we take uh one boxcar uh from Dansville through Corning to Elmira 
okay so we need an engine to move that boxcar 
okay 
um did we use the engine from Avon 
yes we did 
we did 
yep 
um okay alright so we take uh engine E three from Elmira 
yep 
to Dansville 
yep 
then uh we can take that one boxcar to Elmira 
okay 
um then we 
did you all okay so um we need three boxcars all together right 
mm-hm 
so where will we get the other two from there are two already at Elmira 
there are two already at Elimira
okay okay 
so we take engine E three to take the two boxcars there go to Corning then go to Dansville and then go back to Corning 
right 
so that get us to Corning at five am 
okay then we have to uh transfer the OJ into the tanker 
okay we actually we have boxcars right at Corning so we probably need to load the boxcars with oranges 
okay 
okay so we load the boxcars and that takes an hour so at six am we have three boxcars loaded with orange juice at Corning 
okay 
um now we have to put those on the tankers the three tankers 
okay um only orange juice can go onto tankers 
so we have to take the orange juice out of the boxcars into the tankers 
oh no I see see at the orange warehouse we just loaded in oranges into the boxcars 
so what we now gonna have to do is to to turn the oranges into orange juice at the OJ factory 
alright 
so so we have three boxcars of oranges at Corning 
three boxcars of orange juice at Corning 
no um oranges 
oranges 
right 
okay so we have to take the three boxcars of oranges from Corning to Elmira 
yep okay so we get there at eight am 
convert that into orange juice 
okay 
um 
so but that be done at nine am 
take it back to Corning 
yep that be eleven 
put the orange juice into the three tankers 
oh okay actually um oh huh um what what we should have done is is that at Corning 
when we were loading up the oranges into the into the boxcars 
we could have also picked up the three tankers and to have brought them then to Elmira 
yeah 
okay 
okay so then 
can we go back and do that 
sure yep 
okay 
yeah so we can yeah change the plan 
okay so we just go from uh Corning to Elmira 
yep 
with the three tankers 
and the three boxcars of of oranges right 
orange 
right 
okay so we in Elmira we turn them into OJ and and put them into the tanker 
so 
mm-hm 
so that be at nine am 
and then we will take the three tankers 
yep 
to Corning 
yep 
and then to Bath 
okay so we get to um Corning at eleven and then we get to Bath at one 
right 
pm 
okay good 
hello can I help you ? 
yes I need to ship three boxcars of bananas and three tankers of OJ to Bath 
okay 
so let see I should could first take the two boxcars from Elmira 
mm-hm 
uh with engine two 
okay 
and get pick up let see actually what I do is I leave those boxcars there and just take the engine from Elmira 
okay 
and go to Corning and take the three tankers full of OJ 
um the only way you can make OJ is to first pick up some oranges and take them to the orange juice factory 
okay so I will take a boxcar 
okay 
with me for the engine and pick up oranges 
and bring them back to Elmira to the OJ factory 
okay 
where I can make OJ and how many boxcars fills up one tanker do you know 
uh one boxcar fills up one tanker 
okay so I I think I should take both boxcars then to Corning 
okay 
fill them up with OJ and fill them up with oranges bring them back to Elmira to make OJ 
mm-hm 
and then bring them back to Corning and fill the two boxcars with the two tankers switch them 
no you cannot do that you have to keep the orange juice in a tanker you cannot carry it in a boxcar 
oh 
oh okay so I put them in the tanker can I do that 
um oh you didnot take tankers with you when you went to Elmira the first time um you know when you went to Corning to pick up the oranges 
yeah this 
you could pick up the tankers then because you you can never carry the orange juice in a boxcar 
okay 
so I pick up the tankers then 
mm-hm 
and then I have two tankers worth and bring it to Bath 
okay 
okay and then what I do is I do the same thing I bring I go to Elmira and pick up actually I have all three tankers when I do that in Elmira 
so then I have all my three tankers of OJ that I brought to Bath

right by the time you get to Elmira that time it be seven am so if you go back to Corning it be nine by the time you get there if you wanna go back and pick up those other two that you left there 
hm okay ah let see I keep messing this up do you have any suggestions 
um let me see what you can do one thing you can only be can you be using as many engines as engines as you want 
uh yeah it doesnot have any limit on engines 
okay you could use the engine from Avon to pick up some boxcars you could be using the engines two and three you donot have to just depend on engine three 
oh okay 
and you can be you donot have you can be doing things simultaneously like engine one can be doing something as engine two is doing something else 
alright then that what I do I start over 
okay 
and I have engine one go up go up to Dansville and pick three boxcars up 
okay 
and I will have engine three go take its two boxcars to go get its two boxcars from Corning 
okay 
and engine two go get two boxcars at Bath 
okay just a second let me get this down 
okay alright 
wait no there are only two boxcars at Elmira 
engine two so there only two so if engine if engine three took two of the boxcars there would be any left for engine two to take 
right 
oh it has to be carrying a boxcar 
oh no you want engine two to go get the boxcars at Bath is that what you saying 
yeah 
yeah 
okay so just a second let me see what time it be when once you get there 
okay 
okay engine two will get to Bath at five am to pick up those boxcars 
okay 
alright 
and it take an hour to get back to Corning or how 
two hours to get back to Corning 
two hours 
okay and how long from Corning to Elmira 
uh that two hours also 
so it be nine am when I get to Elmira ? 
um unless you want it takes an hour to load though 
right so I would make that 
right 
okay so skip skip Bath then 
okay 
and we just have engine one pick up the three boxcars at Dansville 
okay 
and engine three take the two boxcars to Corning 
okay 
and have have all those boxcars loaded at Corning 
alright 
and have both engines bring back those boxcars to Elmira 
okay 
and now I need to bring I take one of the engines I take engine one 
and bring it back with two boxcars to Corning and fill them up and 
you I donot think you gonna make it on time 
hm 
engine one engine one would even get to Elmira until seven am so if it went back to Corning it would be nine am 
okay what time does engine two get to engine engine three get to Elmira 
engine three will get back to Elmira at I think let me see it would get back there at six 
it get back there at six so and it takes two hours from Corning to from Elmira to Corning 
yeah 
oh I not gonna make it uh okay how long is it from Avon to Bath 
it four hours 
and from Avon to Dansville is four hours 
three hours 
three hours but from Bath to Corning is two right 
right 
okay so it doesnot make a difference it adds up to the same 
um okay well I guess I need to start over then 
okay 
and try it again uh let me see can I uh if I have engine one again go to Dansville and pick up the three boxcars 
okay 
actually wait a minute if I have engine one go to Bath and pick up those two boxcars 
okay 
and bring it back to Corning and have engine two go to Dansville and pick up three boxcars

hello can I help you ? 
yes I have a problem I need to transport two tankers of OJ to Avon and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira the bananas must arrive in Elmira by nine pm 
okay 
um I can only use engine two 
okay 
so and I can only use engine two it all the way over here 
and two tankers of OJ to Avon would mean I take engine two and take the two boxcars 
mm-hm 
from Elmira and bring them over and pick up two tankers and bring them back to Elmira to fill with OJ 
okay do you wanna load the boxcars while you in Corning 
yes 
okay 
and then make the make the OJ in Elmira 
okay 
with engine two and take it from Elmira to Corning to Dansville to Avon 
do you wanna take the boxcars with you or do you want to leave them in Elmira 
uh I will take them with me 
okay so you wanna go from Elmira 
to Avon 
okay by which way 
uh to Corning let me see let me think yeah to Corning to Dansville to Avon 
okay okay then that way it now noon when you arrive in Avon 
okay that fine I guess I still have nine hours 
okay 
um but I need oh oh wait I have something else to say I when I hit when I reach Dansville 
mm-hm 
I wanna pick up uh one more boxcar 
okay 
and bring it with me with the other two to Avon 
okay 
then in Avon I want to load three load those three drop off the one engine drop off the one tanker the two tankers of of oranges and of OJ actually 
mm-hm 
and fill up the three boxcars with bananas 
okay 
and bring them back to Elmira 
which way do we wanna go 
uh to Dansville to Corning to Elmira 
okay let see four pm okay we get there by seven pm 
okay great I am now finished 
hello can I help you ? 
yes uh I have to transport two boxcars of oranges and one tanker of OJ to Avon 
and due to heavy rail traffic the timing of my stops has been predetermined as follows 
the oranges are due to be processed at the factory in Elmira at seven am sharp as soon as the OJ is made the train must leave Elmira 
okay 
and also the train cannot arrive at Avon before three pm because there is no room 
okay 
and it now twelve midnight 
so let see transport two boxcars of oranges and one tanker of OJ 
okay so I gonna take engine three 
mm-hm 
with the two boxcars and bring that to Corning 
okay 
and come back and fill fill those boxcars and fill up and take the tankers 
um how many both tanker how many tankers 
two tankers 
okay 
and bring them to Elmira to make the OJ 
okay 
and hm at the same time 
um I wanna take 
wait why were you did you take both boxcars were you trying to make two tankers 
oh I trying to make one tanker 
okay 
okay so I take one boxcar 
okay 
and fill the tanker and take the tanker to Elmira 
okay 
and with the with the boxcar and make OJ there 
right okay I just wanted to make sure I had done the problem wrong 
uh and uh then I take the other engine 
engine E
while while I filling up the tanker 
uh-huh 
after I after I bring back that boxcar take engine three and go to Corning and fill those two boxcars with oranges 
okay 
and send that over to Avon through Dansville 
okay let let me see how long that take 
okay that get to Avon at noon 
okay and then when I filling up after I fill 
oh wait you cannot get into Avon by at noon though remember you cannot get there till three clock 
the train cannot arrive before three pm because there is no room 
right 
okay so can I sit and wait in a place 
yeah if you wanna stay at Dansville 
yeah 
you can wait 
I can stay at Dansville for I guess how long two hours 
uh if you wait for three hours you would get into Avon exactly at three 
okay so I wait I wait with the two boxcars I wait at Dansville for three hours 
okay 
and then go to Avon and then I still have the tanker of OJ 
mm-hm and it has to leave Elmira as soon as it been processed and it will be finished processing at six am 
yes 
okay so at six am I leave from Elmira 
mm-hm 
to Dansville how long will that take what time will it be when I get there 
um it will be wait that doesnot make sense 
oh it gonna have to wait a little while at Corning otherwise it and the other engine will be running on the track at the same time 
okay 
because of the way loadings so why donot you have it wait at Corning 
okay I have it wait at Corning then while the other one waits at Dansville 
okay 
and what time will it be when it at Corning 
um it will be at Corning at eight am 
okay so I guess let see it take four hours it be twelve so I guess it should wait there also for three hours 
okay 
and then in three hours have both oh they cannot both go over at the same time though can they 
um one can be leaving Dansville while one leaving Corning that not a problem 
okay 
so I guess they both they both leave in three hours after they arrive at their destination 
okay 
so that have it will also pull into Avon at about three pm 
okay 
or or you could have it wait four you should have it wait four hours do you have a time limit of when you need to be in Avon at all 
uh nope just cannot be there before three pm 
okay why donot you have it wait there four hours then and then it get in there at four pm 
okay that what I do 
okay 
I am now finished 
good day mate 
hi um to ship three boxcars of bananas 
um I have to take the three boxcars from Dansville to Avon 
and then from Avon to Bath 
um then I have to take I guess a boxcar to Corning 
then take three tankers of oranges to hm Elmira 
um fill up with orange juice um 
you only be able to fill them with orange juice if in fact there are oranges at Elmira that can be processed into orange juice 
so I pick up can I take oranges um on tankers from Corning 
no you may not they must be in boxcars 
they must be in boxcars 
um alright so I have to take let see so I have to take the boxcars from Dansville to get the bananas 
um then I drive those boxcars to Bath then I take two boxcars to Corning 
how many mm fill up with oranges um two boxcars full of oranges will make how many tankers full of orange juice 
two 
two so then I have to take two boxcars pick fill them up with oranges um go to Elmira 
um from Elmira and you have to take two the two boxcars back 
um fill up the two tankers with orange juice and drive those back to Bath 
then take one more boxcar from Bath to Corning fill up with oranges 
um then go to Corning 
there are no boxcars available with Bath unless you talking about the ones that are filled with bananas 
no there it says there two boxcars available 
yes you picked those up on the way to Corning originally 
right but I mm there mm I took those two boxcars 
filled it up filled those up with oranges then drove to Elmira 
where they were made into orange juice then didnot those two boxcars come back 
very well 
and then do they have like can I leave them there and fill the tankers or do they have to like come back to Bath 
I can move the two boxcars full of oranges or orange juice then put them on the two tankers and take the two tankers back to Bath 
right 
um 
do you need the bananas in boxcars at Bath 
the bananas 
I think the bananas are already there because like 
no they are there but if you donot need them to be in in boxcars we can unload them and then reuse the boxcars on the way to Corning 
right 
alright then unload the boxcars and then I guess then we can take three boxcars from Bath to Corning fill up with oranges 
um take those from Corning to Elmira make the orange juice 
um take the orange juice back to Corning fill up the three tankers and go back to Bath 
we fill the three tankers at Elmira I would presume because that where we making the orange juice 
so the tankers are available at Elmira they only available at Corning 
that correct so you would need to take them on your while you taking your oranges you should take the tankers to Elmira 
alright 
alright so I got the three boxcars and I take the three tankers three boxcars of oranges three tankers take those all to Elmira 
make the orange juice take the three tankers back to Corning and then back to Bath 
very good that would leave you with two boxcars of bananas at Bath an additional load of bananas stored at Bath 
uh three empty boxcars at Bath and three tankers full of orange juice at Bath 
let me calculate how long that will take 
engine E one is going to travel to from Avon to Dansville and take approximately three hours so at three am it will arrive at Dansville and pick up three boxcars 
I would then recommend instead of it okay never mind uh we then returning to Avon 
it now seven am we picking up bananas and traveling to Bath and we arrive there at noon 
we unload up one load of bananas and decouple the other two boxcars picking up two empty ones um 
and we then travel to Corning and arrive there at three pm 
at that point we load all three boxcars with oranges pick up the three empty tankers and travel toward Elmira 
at Elmira we unload the oranges and convert them into orange juice 
and travel back to Corning with the orange juice 
and then travel back to Bath with the orange juice 
and we arrive there by midnight the next day 
is that good 
you didnot give me a time limit on the problem so 
there is there no time limit 
then that looks like a reasonable plan 
okay 
hello can I help you ? 
um yes how long would it take to take one tanker from Corning to Elmira 
it would take two hours 
and so I assume it would take the same amount back 
that 
alright um so if I take one tanker from of oranges full of oranges can I do that 
no you can not 
we only take boxcars alright if I drive one boxcar from Bath to Corning how long will that take 
uh would take two hours assuming you have an engine at Bath 
okay 
at oh I need an engine there 
yep boxcars donot travel by themselves 
okay alright if I take an engine from Avon to Bath engine E one how long will that take 
four hours 
mm okay four hours from Avon to Bath 
and then I guess attach that to the boxcar to Corning it four hours and how long is it two hours from Bath to Corning 
that correct 
six hours okay take a boxcar how long would it take to load up the oranges 
an hour 
an hour so that seven 
um and then take the boxcar from Corning to Elmira and that would take two hours 
that correct 
that nine um 
okay and how long to make orange juice with a boxcar 
it would take one hour to unload the oranges and another hour to manufacture the orange juice however we have to have a tanker there so I assuming you also be taking a tanker from Corning 
oh okay take a tanker there uh-hm 
okay so it two hours and then um put the orange juice on the tanker 
um back to Corning that would be another two hours 
that correct 
so that 
loading the orange juice will take another hour uh plus two hours to go to Corning 
hm 
and from say from Corning to Dansville how long would that take for it to take the two can it take the tanker there 
can 
there a tanker now at Corning and then you want to go to Dansville will take one more hour 
and from Dansville to Avon 
three hours 
are you keeping track do you know how many hours are left 
uh the total of nineteen hours 
oh that would work apparently wait wait let see maybe it would yeah it would right nineteen hours did you say 
yes what is your deadline 
ah three pm that not gonna work 
alright um if I take alright if I take the engine and a boxcar from Elmira 
yes 
uh I just use it engine two and a boxcar from Elmira to Corning how long will that take 
that would take two hours 
and loading up a boxcar of oranges at Corning 
right you now at three hours 
three hours and going back to Elmira would is two hours 
correct I assume you taking a tanker again 
um yeah taking a tanker then making the orange juice 
right unloading the oranges making the orange juice and loading the tanker is a total of three hours 
and then taking the tanker back um to Corning 
yes you now at ten hours 
back to Dansville 
eleven hours 
and back to Avon 
uh fourteen hours 
so that should work 
that correct your deadline would have been fifteen hours 
okay so that the plan 
we will execute it 
hello can I help you ? 
yes um to take two boxcars with the two engines from Elmira to Corning is would be how many hours 
two hours 
two hours 
and then loading up those two um 
with oranges 
with oranges and back to Bath would be how many hours 
uh an additional three hours total of five 
um can you do can you do things simultaneously here or do they have to be done like one like can I have the same time having it the engine 
from going from Avon to Dansville picking up a boxcar or cannot do that simultaneously 
uh yes the all the engines can can act independently 
okay so at the same time um can I have engine well if I take engine one and pick up a boxcar can I pick up all three boxcars on the same engine 
you certainly can 
oh okay then take up engine one pick up the three boxcars and 
at Dansville I assume 
at Dansville 
and to go to to Corning and load up the three boxcars of oranges how long would that take 
um at five hours it will have all three boxcars loaded at Corning 
so five hours into your plan E one E two and E three will all be at Corning 
uh-huh 
um with loaded boxcars 
E one will have three loaded boxcars E two and E three will each have one load boxcar of oranges 
alright and from Corning to to Bath how long would that take 
uh two hours 
okay um 
I supposed to get the maximum number of boxcars of oranges um that you could get to Bath by seven am 
I donot know if that is that the maximum number possible I donot 
um it will take me a few minutes to calculate whether another plan is available um 
the only additional boxcars available are at Bath and it is impossible to use them in any plan that must be achieved by seven am 
therefore I would conclude that you have gotten the maximum number of boxcars to Bath within the required time frame 
okay so that is the plan 
we will execute it faithfully 
hello can I help you ? 
alright um 
I think that I want to let see hm hm can I if I drive the engine up from Avon to Dansville and pick up three boxcars 
and back to Avon how long will that take 
uh six hours 
alright and I load up three boxcars of bananas how long will that 
an additional hour 
alright then um from Avon I wanna go from Avon to Bath drop off one boxcar of bananas 
and then pick up two more boxcars at Bath how long will that take 
um a grand total of eleven hours 
okay um 
then I wanna go to Corning drop off a boxcar of banana 
and pick up um two boxcars the two boxcars from Bath full of oranges 
what two boxcars in Bath full of oranges 
when I if when I go from Avon to Bath can I pick up two additional boxcars there at Bath 
right 
and then take those two to Corning drop off one boxcar of bananas 
and load the other two the other two from Bath up with oranges 
and take two tankers to Elmira 
okay let see so we we eleven hours at Bath 
you dropping a boxcar of bananas you picking up the two available boxcars taking them to Corning filling the two available boxcars with oranges 
mm-hm 
so now 
and then dropping off one of the boxcars of bananas 
okay and then we traveling to Elmira 
Elmira with also two tankers and then um making the orange juice 
at Elmira 
mm-hm and then taking the two let see two tankers oh yeah and then at Elmira dropping off a boxcar of of bananas that should be the last one 
okay we now have two tankers full of orange juice 
um as well as two empty boxcars connected to your engine E one at Elmira and uh dropping off the bananas we now nineteen hours into the plan 
alright um and then I guess taking the tankers from Elmira how many hours are we into the plan 
nineteen 
okay from Elmira to Corning to Dansville back to Avon 
that will take a total of twenty five hours 
hm um let see 
I remind you that your other engines may operate simultaneously and independently of engine E one 
okay um 
if I okay if it at the same time I take let see the the engine pick up the three boxcars from Dansville then load up the bananas and drop those off 
can I have engine two pick up the two boxcars from Elmira 
and go to Corning pick up two um things of oranges 
uh take two tankers back to Elmira make oranges to orange juice 
yes 
and that will at the same time as the the boxcars starts from Dansville I mean the engine starts from Avon to Dansville 
yeah 
yes 
and how long would that be 
um we now at Elmira with orange juice loaded and it eight hours into the plan 
right 
okay um and then from the orange juice and the two tankers from back to Corning Dansville and back to Avon 
fourteen hours into the plan 
okay fourteen hours and 
and the other engine assuming that you maintaining the part of the plan where you delivering bananas 
right 
um starting at Avon would complete by dropping the last one off at Elmira approximately sixteen hours into the plan 
mm-hm 
alright so that should that should work I have to be back by twenty four hours 
then we will faithfully execute your plan 
alright 
hello can I help you ? 
yes um if I take engine two and the two boxcars from Elmira to Corning and pick up two boxcars of oranges 
and I take the two tankers back to Elmira um make the orange juice how long will that take 
so you loaded tankers eight hours 
okay and from Elmira um take the two tankers of orange juice back to Avon 
total of fourteen hours 
fourteen um hm 
hm 
hm 
so how long will take if I take the two boxcars ship from Elmira to Corning load up the oranges take the two tankers to Elmira and then make orange juice there 
eight hours 
eight hours 
hm and for okay 
um 
I now have eleven hours to get boxcars of oranges um to get two tankers of OJ ship from Elmira to Avon 
can you see a shorter plan 
not immediately 
hm mm how many hours you said it took thirteen hours 
total of fourteen 
mm have thirteen hours um 
ah 
it possible I misreading the instructions here um 
I read one hour to unload at Elmira one hour to make orange juice and then one hour to load the train 
to load the two tankers 
right 
that three 
and that a total of three hours now it possible that this can be read that it can be manufactured directly onto the train and then you save an hour 
would that could can you do that 
I donot know I donot I donot have more complete instructions here so that needs to be clarified 
mm well 
so I I would call the uh I would call the plan or something something is faulty at this point and we probably have to stop 
okay 
hello can I help you ?

okay so I have boxcars in Elmira and tankers in Corning right 
mm-hm

so let see one boxcar of bananas okay well I suppose one boxcar of oranges well to Bath hm 
okay well I guess I just take my engine from Avon to Dansville which is three hours 
and pick up two boxcars 
um go back where should we okay go from Dansville to Corning which is how long two hours 
Dansville to Corning is one hour 
one hour um then fill up one of the boxcars with oranges and 
um there are oranges at Corning 
there are 
oh no sorry there are yeah 
okay 
right and um hm then I guess is it faster to go from Corning to Avon or from Corning like through Bath or through Dansville is my question 
okay it faster to go to from Corning to Avon through Dansville that takes four hours 
okay 
okay so I go back the the way I came and then fill up the second car with bananas 
wait I not keeping track of the time am I 
okay that three hours to Dansville it twelve midnight now so it three in the morning another hour 
mm-hm one hour to Corning 
okay one hour Corning that four in the morning an hour to load right 
one hour to load yep 
that five in the morning I still have plenty of time and then and then it four hours back 
four hours back 
so where was I five nine in the morning one hour to load that ten in the morning right 
mm-hm 
and then how many hours to Bath from Avon 
um Bath from Avon is four 
oh then we not gonna make it by twelve are we um 
hm 
you have to 
oh I can go I can go from Avon pick up the two boxcars right 
and then go to Corning 
well no it doesnot make any sense either way anyway then so we a little late 
and would the 
so what your task it to take one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges 
and one tanker of OJ to Bath to the I can take a tanker from Corning to Elmira in how many hours 
Corning to Elmira takes two hours 
so two load one hour and then from Elmira to Bath 
Elmira to Bath is four hours 
it four hours so um two three so we can get that there by seven in the morning 
then that not a problem but I donot see how I can get the boxcar of bananas and the boxcar of oranges to Bath by twelve if we gotta go all over the place to pick up the boxcars 
is it possible to get one and 
maybe you could start with a different engine 
different engine yeah 
you donot have to start in Avon I suppose 
yeah I guess so well okay so I start in Elmira with one engine and the two boxcars 
mm-hm 
okay and then I can drive straight to Corning 
mm-hm 
from Elmira which is how many hours again 
Elmira to Corning is two hours 
two hours so that two in the morning one hour to load 
mm-hm 
and then four hours from Corning to Avon right 
four hours to Corning from Corning to Avon yes 
okay so that was three in the morning seven in the morning an hour to load 
that eight in the morning and then four hours oh that okay then that works and then we make it by twelve 
um how are you getting the orange juice 
oh well I I already said that that was um that was to um take a tanker from Corning to Elmira which is an hour an hour to load 
no Corning to Elmira is two hours 
two hours oh okay 
so that and then an hour to load which is makes it uh three in the morning 
and then four hours to Bath correct 
right well why donot you keep the whole 
I cannot separate it 
well you could but it be faster just you have to start with the engine in well either in Elmira or Avon right 
right 
and then you have to get to the oranges and then back to the orange juice factory 
I have to bring the oranges to the orange juice factory 
I believe so 
donot they have oranges there 
I think you have to 
I have to 
okay this is getting complicated 
so I have to not only but no my my problem is to get a boxcar of bananas a boxcar of oranges and one tanker of orange juice to Bath 
it doesnot say they all have to arrive at the same time or all have to go together 
right but it 
but they just have to be there by noon 
okay so let go through your plan 
okay 
so what your plan 
my plan is to go well first we work on the orange juice 
okay 
I have a tanker in Corning 
mm-hm 
I drive the tanker from Corning to Elmira 
you cannot drive the tanker without an engine 
a tanker 
the tanker needs an engine 
I thought a tanker was just truck or is it a 
it one of those round things that gets pulled by an engine 
oh with it part of the train oh I see okay and then that that why I was confused 
okay so we start in 
start in Elmira 
huh Elmira with two boxcars in we go to Corning and we pick up a a tanker 
mm-hm 
and then we go back to Elmira 
okay 
um so it two hours there two hours back that four hours fill up an hour that five in the morning 
well if you gonna make orange juice you have to pick up orange juice it in Corning in order to make orange juice 
I have to pick up oranges and then for them to make orange juice I have to bring them the oranges 
exactly 
okay so okay 
so 
okay um picking up an engine and two boxcars in Elmira I going to Corning picking up a tanker an hour for loading 
mm-hm 
so that three in the morning 
so 
three in the morning 
and then from Corning to Elmira it another two hours that five 
another hour to load that six 
okay 
and then I drive from Elmira to Corning back to Corning 
okay 
I guess I could 
you could filled up two for the price of one 
fill the 
okay so I done that 
so 
you already done that fine 
okay so I go straight to Avon and I get the bananas 
so that another 
four 
four hours is that right okay 
and then another hour for loading are you keeping track of what time it is or should I 
um so should we should be at eleven I think 
eleven but that that doesnot give enough still doesnot give us enough time to get to Bath right 
cause it what another three hours or four hours 
right 
so we cannot make it in time then it be late 
well maybe we could use separate engines 
okay yeah I suppose fine 
alright so I can send them out both at the same time right 
right 
both engines can go at the same time 
okay so one engine will go to do what I just said and just do the orange juice right 
right so it will go from Corning to Bath at the end 
right 
okay 
right and then the other engine will go with the two boxcars and do what I said 
you know by going from Elmira to Avon oh Elmira stopping in Corning and then oh 
no the other engine can start at Avon go to Dansville back to Avon and pick up the bananas and go to Bath 
that time oh start at but it okay yeah should I I mean that fine with me 
oh actually no it 
I think that would be 
okay so what you final plan 
okay first off I using both engines from Elmira 
okay 
one is gonna go by itself and pick up one tanker of can I carry oranges in tankers 
no 
then I cannot do that then 
you can take boxcars with you at there are boxcars available at Elmira 
three right two well I guess alright and then I pick up another one on the way 
alright so each engine has one boxcar I go to Corning one of the engine goes picks up a they both fill up with oranges that another hour 
okay so we at three in the morning 
right 
okay 
so and then one of the engines heads back to Elmira 
okay 
that 
five am 
five am and then loads picks up a tanker 
alright 
and then and then fills up with orange juice 
so that six am 
okay and then go straight from Elmira to Bath 
that ten am 
yes and 
so at ten am we have one tanker of OJ at Bath 
right 
okay 
okay and so the other engine which has one boxcar 
mm-hm 
goes so we have just one tanker okay goes to goes from Elmira to Dansville 
okay so it gets there at three donot you want to pick up oranges on the way

hello can I help you 
uh yes I need to my problem is uh engine E one 
yep 
leaves Avon every night at midnight picks up boxcars in Dansville 
okay 
and then continue runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville until nine am 
okay 
carrying three boxcars of bananas to Dansville on every trip 
three boxcars of bananas from where to where 
from Dansville 
okay 
to Dansville sorry 
okay to Dansville okay 
to Dansville from Avon 
okay 
um your task is to transport two boxcars of oranges to Avon by nine am it is now twelve midnight 
okay so we have one engine going back and forth between Avon and Dansville right 
right 
bringing bananas there 
right 
okay so and that engine E one 
mm-hm 
okay so we need to we need to do do what again get something else to Avon 
we need to transport two boxcars of oranges 
okay 
to Avon 
okay 
by nine am 
okay 
it now twelve midnight 
okay 
okay 
okay so 
alright so we just need to get um let see we need to get um to Dansville two boxcars of oranges 
right 
why to Dansville I thought we had to go to Avon 
well cause it uh the engine goes from uh runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville 
okay 
until nine am 
okay 
so it not gonna be going to the easiest way since it not going to Bath or Corning 
oh okay 
okay okay I see what you saying okay good 
okay so um need to get two boxcars of oranges to Avon 
okay 
through Dansville 
okay 
um let me see where are the oranges are in Corning 
right 
um there are three boxcars in Dansville 
yep 
um 
oh there also two in Elmira 
two in Elmira oh um hm okay 
so all that we need is two boxcars of oranges right 
yes 
okay 
um which is the shorter distance from Dansville to Corning or Elmira to Corning 
it actually only one hour from Corning to Dansville but the thing is is that we donot have an engine in Dansville anyways right 
oh okay 
so 
alright so uh from Elmira we bring uh two boxcars 
okay 
with engine E two 
okay 
to Corning 
okay so that get to Corning at two am 
mm-hm and then we will put uh fill the boxcars with oranges 
okay so that be three am then 
then take the two boxcars through Dansville to Avon 
okay um so from Corning to Dansville was one hour 
mm-hm 
okay so that was so we get to Dansville about four am now the other problem is is that if we have this train so we also have engine E one that going back and forth right 
oh right that 
okay so I wondering if we gonna um so we have to make sure that we donot run into that train 
mm-hm 
so if we get to Dansville at four am so engine E one is going back and forth starting at midnight till nine am 
mm-hm 
bringing okay so it must so from so from midnight to nine am it going back and forth 
mm-hm 
oh okay 
what is it going back and forth on just an engine can we use that engine 
yeah so what we could do is is that if it well it gonna get to so it gets to Avon so it starts at Avon right so at three am it get to Dansville 
then it must drop off then maybe it unloads the oranges I not uh the the bananas 
um picks up boxcars in Dansville 
yep 
and then continually runs back and forth between Avon and Dansville 
okay 
carrying three boxcars of bananas to Dansville on every trip 
okay 
okay 
so it it 
and that runs until what time 
until nine am 
okay so at three am it would get to Dansville it would pick up the three boxcars and then go back to Avon 
no it would uh it will be carrying three box of bananas to Dansville 
right to Dansville okay 
so it will be returning to Avon empty 
right okay so we could actually have it so we not gonna get to Dansville until four am 
so we would have missed it when it was there at three am 
mm-hm 
so we could just probably so now the so what we probably gonna have to do is to actually wait at Dansville until it next comes 
right 
okay 
okay 
so which will probably be around um so it must have it must load the bananas into those three boxcars 
so it would leave Avon at seven 
and get to Dansville or actually the other thing is is that why donot we just um go via Bath to to Avon 
okay 
even though that route a bit longer at least then we donot have any conflict 
it will save time 
okay 
yeah because then so if we get to so we were at Corning at so we had the boxcars loaded up at three am 
so we go to Bath that be five am we go to Avon that be nine am 
mm-hm 
right 
so we get there at nine am 
okay 
okay 
hello can I help you 
yeah I need to ship one boxcar of bananas one boxcar of oranges and one tanker of OJ to Bath 
okay 
and all three commodities must be in Bath by noon and it now twelve midnight 
okay 
um there was 
okay 
one boxcar of bananas and start there 
okay 
we need to get one boxcar of bananas in to Bath 
okay 
um 
so 
the banana warehouse is in Avon 
yep 
um two boxcars are in Bath 
yep 
um let me see we get uh an engine from Avon to Bath 
okay 
and then to send a boxcar with engine back to Avon 
okay actually it would be quicker if we went via Dansville because it only three hours from Avon to Dansville 
oh 
whereas it four hours from Avon to Bath so why donot we have E one go to Dansville and pick up a boxcar there 
okay then then I have to go through Corning right 
no so we what we can do oh now is this to do the bananas right 
mm-hm 
so if we just take engine E one from Avon to Dansville 
mm-hm 
pick up a boxcar and then go back to Avon with the boxcar 
okay alright I see 
alright then uh we fill the fill the boxcar in Avon with bananas 
yep 
and then we go back to Bath 
okay so that get us to Bath at six hours plus one hour is seven plus four is is so we would get to Bath at eleven am 
with having engine E one bring a boxcar of bananas 
okay eleven am 
yep so that before noon so so that fine 
okay we also need a boxcar of oranges 
right and a boxcar of and a tanker of OJ right

okay so we met times for both deliveries right 
um yep 
okay 
good 
hello can I help you 
um here the problem we need to transport two tankers of orange juice to Avon and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira 
okay so wait a second two tankers of 
orange juice 
yep 
to Avon 
to Avon okay 
three boxcars of bananas 
yep 
to Elmira 
okay 
the bananas must arrive at nine pm 
nine pm 
right 
okay 
um the 
oh so it lots of time 
okay and there is a set time for um 
okay 
the orange juice however our problem is that all the other engines are in in undergoing maintenance 
okay so which engine can we use 
engine number two 
okay oh 
and since there a time limit on the bananas I think we should work with that problem first 
right right okay so E two so we need three boxcars of bananas into Elmira okay 
okay I think that we should um from Elmira take engine number two 
yep 
yep 
and we need to go to um Avon and 
right so we also need three boxcars empty boxcars to bring with us 
can we use the boxcars there in Dansville since there three there 
yeah yeah and then as well um um Dansville is on the faster path to Avon so that works out well 
so we go so we take E two from Elmira to Corning it get there at two am and then to Dansville 
it get there at three am we pick up three boxcars and go to Avon and we get there 
wait a minute 
at six am 
yep 
um 
okay we get there at six am 
okay 
alright we need to load the uh three boxcars 
yep 
and return to Elmira 
okay so it be seven am by the time we load in load the bananas then we want to go back to Elmira 
so that get us to Dansville at ten am that get us to Corning at eleven am 
can we 
that get us into Elmira at one pm 
if we stop to pick up two tankers in Corning 
yep 
will that delay us 
no 
oh we need to pick up two tankers in Corning 
okay so what we want to do is is that on the way back we gonna pick up two tankers 
okay 
okay um oh wait a second those tankers are empty though right 
right 
okay so okay so um okay 
so at one pm here the we will have our three loaded boxcars of bananas and we have two empty tankers of OJ 
at one pm in Elmira 
right 
okay um 
and we would but we would have any oranges though to actually make the orange juice 
oh wow we didnot load up the 
right 
okay 
so 
I think we need to uh I need we need to um in the initial trip 
yep 
uh when we went to pick up the bananas I think we needed to take uh the two boxcars from Elmira plus pick up three boxcars from Dansville 
okay so actually we could just leave the two boxcars at Corning 
so we could just take the two boxcars in from Elmira to Corning okay let me note that 
right 
so two okay 
so when we come back we can have those so what we do is is so we drop off the two boxcars in Corning 
and then while we going to Dansville we could have them loaded up then 
right 
okay 
so it gonna be one pm so let go back to when we come back to Corning right 
we have three boxcars of bananas and we have two boxcars of oranges waiting for us 
now the problem is that one engine can pull at most three loaded boxcars 
so we gonna have to leave those so we either have to leave the bananas at Corning or we have to leave the oranges there 
okay leave the oranges 
okay 
okay we take the bananas deliver them to Elmira 
yeah 
and it one clock in Elmira right 
yep 
alright then we go back to Corning 
okay 
so pick up the two boxcars of oranges and two tankers 
okay 
okay 
okay 
okay and now we back on route to Elmira to make orange juice 
okay so we get to so at Corning so we be at Corning at three am we be in Elmira at five am five pm I mean 
okay um and to make the orange juice orange juice and load the tankers 
yep 
uh that an hour 
um yep so that be six pm 
wait a minute where am I now oh I we done 
oh but I thought we had to get the orange juice to Avon 
no 
oh okay 
oh I thought it was two tankers of OJ to Avon and three boxcars of bananas to Elmira 
oh yeah you right you right 
okay now we have to go to Avon I sorry 
okay 
okay so now to get to Avon it gonna take two six more hours so we get to Avon at midnight the next day 
okay 
with the two tankers of OJ 
well there was a time limit so I guess that okay 
okay good but then we done 
alright 
hello can I help you 
um yeah I have to transport four boxcars of oranges to Bath by two pm 
okay 
um so I guess let see Bath um boxcars are available um in Dansville and Elmira right 
yes 
and um if it let see um how long would it take to get an engine to pick those up 
if I well let see if two are in Elmira with the engine and I have to go to Danville how long would that take to get another two 
so you want to take an engine and boxcar from Elmira to Dansville is that what you asking 
um I guess take one engine and two boxcars 
okay 
yeah from Elmira to Dansville 
that would take three hours 
three hours 
okay um oh wait then where are the oranges the oranges are oh in the orange okay and then back to Corning how would that how long that would take 
okay um to take an engine and two boxcars from Elmira to Dansville would take three hours and then you want to pick up another one and go back to Corning 
um yes 
okay um that would be 
oh actually two 
that be five hours in all 
okay and then how about to go to Bath 
um from Corning 
yeah 
that two hours 
two hours so that seven hours in all with 
yes but it takes an hour to load the oranges 
oh it does okay so that eight 
I donot know though if it an hour per boxcar or an hour in all 
oh 
that a problem 
okay 
I donot know if I can give any help on that either let see it takes one hour to load or unload any amount of cargo on a train 
so I guess that would be an hour no matter how many boxcars you have 
okay 
so if we want to get there by two pm and it takes eight hours in all 
so that would um if we left at six in the morning would that make sense six 
um yeah I guess um or we could leave now I guess it doesnot matter um does that sound like it makes sense to transport 
okay which which engine do you wanna take from Elmira 
um are there differences in the engines 
no I just it just makes it clearer 
oh okay um I guess engine two 
okay 
with the two boxcars that are available there 
okay 
um do you have to go through Corning to get to Dansville is that 
yes you do 
you do okay um 
so yeah um I guess the instructions are would I be giving you instructions I donot even know 
yeah you have you decide what the plan is 
okay um 
yeah um 
so take engine two with two boxcars um from Elmira to Dansville and there pick up another two boxcars and travel to Corning 
okay 
load the oranges and 
you want to pick up two boxcars or one at Dansville 
um two since we there only two available in Elmira 
okay you can only carry um you can carry three empty boxcars that would be fine but once you get them loaded you can carry as many um unloaded boxcars as you want but once you get them loaded you can only carry three at a time 
mm-hm 
oh okay 
just so you know 
okay so then um why donot uh hm um okay so why donot um take engine two 
with the two boxcars available 
mm-hm 
um go from Elmira to Corning 
pick up and load two um the two uh boxcars on engine two with oranges and then continue to Bath 
um at the same time engine three would go um from Elmira to Corning to Dansville 
pick up the two oh well yeah pick up the two boxcars that are available there travel back to Corning 
okay 
load those and then go to Bath 
oh okay 
um and the time there no if we left now the time would affect that would it 
oh okay so you it twelve am now right 
yeah 
so it takes ooh if you leave Elmira at twelve am with the two boxcars you get to Corning at two am 
and it takes you an hour to load the oranges so you have them loaded by three am 
mm-hm 
do you want to go right from there to Bath as soon as you have those two loaded 
um yep I guess so 
okay those get to Bath at five am 
now meanwhile while this is happening you want engine three to go to Dansville and pick up two more boxcars 
well what the difference if um those boxcars arrive at Bath at three am that right 
uh-huh 
um 
uh no at five am 
five am okay is it faster for those for that engine to drop off those two boxcars travel back to Dansville than um to have engine three 
um no it the same uh amount of time from Elmira to Dansville as it is from Bath to Dansville 
okay so then yeah I guess just have the the original take the two have them leave at the same time 
okay um so engine E three to Dansville 
yep 
okay that gets there at three am I sorry I a little bit slow 
no that okay you know more than I do 
uh not really 
um that get there at three am load up the boxcars be back at Corning at four am 
load the oranges and get to Bath at that will get there at seven am 
okay that fine 
so 
that way before two pm 
I guess you set 
yep um I now finished 
hello can I help you 
um yeah I interested in shipping two boxcars of bananas and two boxcars of oranges to Dansville and all cargo must arrive by ten am 
okay 
um 
right now it looks like the bananas are in one place with an engine and no boxcars 
and the oranges are um in where are the oranges the oranges are in Corning with tankers but no boxcars 
right 
um 
so let see 
if um oh and okay uh and it still the case that um only four boxcars with cargo can go at a time is that right 
um three 
three yeah that what I meant okay um so let see um 
how long does it take to get from Avon to Bath 
four hours 
four hours and then from oh okay let see and how about Avon to Dansville 
three hours 
okay so if you go from Avon to Dansville pick up two boxcars 
go back hm how about um how long is it from Elmira to Dansville 
Elmira to Dansville is three hours 
okay um 
so why donot uh I send engine two with two boxcars to Corning 
okay 
um 
to pick up two boxes of oranges or two boxcars of oranges 
okay 
so that will take uh but no four hours is that right 
um from Elmira to Corning is two hours and to load them will take another so that be by three am 
oh it two 
okay 
and then um take that on to Dansville 
okay 
and that take how long 
um you be in Dansville at four am 
four am okay um 
and then to get bananas there um I guess take engine one from Avon to Bath 
okay 
and then go back to Avon that take eight hours is that right 
you want to pick up the boxcars in Bath 
yeah 
okay that take yes eight hours 
and then load uh two boxcars with bananas so that take another hour is that right 
uh-huh 
and then on to Dansville which take 
one other hour so you be there at ten am 
oh we will be there at ten am okay 
uh-huh 
okay is there any additional information I missing 
no let me check it over you wanna take you wanna take engine E one 
mm-hm 
to Bath pick up the boxcars that four hours go back to Avon that another four hours 
load the bananas and then go to Dansville you be there exactly at ten am 
meanwhile engine E two um with two boxcars to Corning 
you be there at two am load two boxes of boxcars with oranges that be done by three am and that be in Dansville at four am yeah that sounds fine 
okay actually did you say from Avon to um Bath is four hours and from Avon to Dansville is three 
yes 
okay um since all cargo must arrive by ten am 
oh yeah 
um I guess I switch from um instead of going to Avon to Bath and picking up the boxcars I go from Avon to Dansville 
okay 
and then back to Avon load those and um go to Dansville 
okay 
with engine one 
so engine one to Dansville and back takes six hours six am load them by nine am 
wait 
okay engine E one to Dansville that three hours and back that be by six am 
load the bananas by seven am and take yeah that would be there at ten am 
oh they both get there at ten am 
no the bananas will get there at ten am and the oranges will get there at four am 
yeah 
but was from Avon to Bath also gonna take 
I added wrong 
oh so that would gotten there at eleven 
yeah 
oh okay so yeah I guess that the only option there is 
right 
okay um I now finished 
okay 
hello can I help you 
um yeah I wanna try and get seven boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine am 
um let see uh 
okay I guess how it takes how long to get from Elmira to Corning 
two hours 
two hours um 
okay so um I guess I like to take um and tankers only take orange juice right 
right they cannot carry oranges 
yeah okay um 
so not seven boxcars I have how many boxcars there two oh 
okay I guess um well how many it how long is from Corning to Elmira an hour 
two hours 
two hours okay so if I take engine two and engine three um both to Corning 
um and engine two with both boxcars 
um 
okay you have to send one of those about an hour behind the other they cannot both travel along at once 
oh yes 
unless you connect them to each other 
uh-huh um I can connect them to each other 
yeah 
with the boxcars also 
I believe so as long as the boxcars are full 
okay I do that 
okay 
and then um does it take any time to disconnect them or anything like that 
no that doesnot take any time 
okay so um connect engine two and engine three and the two boxcars which are in Elmira and send them to um Corning 
where engine three uh 
uh let see how I can do this um engine three will load up with two boxcars of oranges and go back to Elmira 
and engine two will go to Dansville and pick up the three boxcars that are available there 
okay 
how long will it take to get from Corning to Dansville 
Corning to Dansville is one hour 
okay 
so you want engine three to stay there with the two boxcars and load them with oranges 
oh in the one hour so the time 
no I mean the you taken engine E three from Elmira to Corning and it and it with engine E two and they both got the boxcars 
uh-huh 
you do you want engine three to stay in Corning with the two boxcars and load up oranges as engine E two is going to Dansville 
um yeah 
okay 
um and then well let see then so in the hour that it takes um to get for engine two to get from Corning to Dansville 
um engine three will be taking three um no two boxcars to Elmira which take is that two hours 
from Corning to Elmira is two hours yes 
Corning to Elmira 
okay hm um cannot remember that one 
okay so then in so by the time um by the time engine three arrives at Elmira 
that be what time wow um nine ten eleven 
okay engine three is staying in Corning and loading up oranges engine two is the one that went to Dansville 
oh okay okay 
okay 
alright 
so engine two is loading oranges and that take an hour 
um what time would it now be 
okay wait I confused do you want engine three to stay in Corning and load oranges and engine E two to go pick up the other boxcars at Dansville 
sure 
or do you want the other way around 
either way it 
okay 
um alright so engine three will engine three will stay in Corning and load the oranges and it will have two boxcars of oranges loaded at three am 
meanwhile engine two will go to Dansville and pick up the other three boxcars 
mm-hm 
um it be there it get to Dansville at three am and then you wanna do you take want to take those back to Elmira 
so engine E two with three boxcars will be back in Elmira at six am 
is that what you wanna do 
with 
now I confused um engine two with three boxcars 
did you wanna pick up all three boxcars at Dansville 
oh yes oh okay 
okay 
oh so it went from Dansville to Corning to Elmira 
okay why do you wanna go back to Elmira 
I have to get seven boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine am 
okay so those be there 
did you the three boxcars from Dansville do you want them to stop in Corning and load and then go to Elmira 
yeah 
okay 
donot 
they be there 
donot they have to 
yeah 
okay 
I just wanted to clarify that 
okay 
okay so those three will be back in Elmira at seven am 
and the other 
and 
the other two can be there at five am 
okay 
okay can I run tracks I can run trains on the in the opposite direction right 
no 
so is this impossible 
let me see it depends on how the timing works give me a minute 
okay 
um let see we got the two engines that go to Corning 
mm let me see 
no because while one is coming back from Dansville the one from Corning can be going to Elmira it can be there 
I donot think you need to have any running against the grain at any time 
so if they both okay both engine two and engine three go from Elmira to Corning they get there by two am 
uh-huh 
and then engine two or engine three or how you have it I donot want to mess you up 
engine three is staying in Corning and engine two is going to Dansville 
okay 
okay so engine two proceeds to Dansville gets there by three 
uh-huh 
while um engine three stays and loads and then takes so that at three clock and then 
uh-huh 
by five 
it can be back in Elmira 
right 
and by five um engine two can be loaded to go so by seven 
it be back in Elmira 
okay so 
I think I gonna say this is impossible unless how long does it take from get to Corning to Bath 
Corning to Bath is two hours 
oh wait um and to get engine one 
oh hold on engine to get from to get engine one from Avon to Dansville takes three hours right 
engine one from Avon to Dansville yes 
and then um so that could get there by nine ten no by twelve three 
and then hm okay um how about if I do all that and then at the same time have engine one running from Avon to Bath 
okay 
cause we by that time yeah yeah from Avon to Bath and then from Bath to Corning 
mm-hm 
and then from Corning to Elmira can I do that with the tracks 
um yes you can 
so you want 
and that be there by nine am right 
so you want engine E one to pick up the two boxcars in Bath 
yeah 
mm-hm 
okay and then get to Corning that take it be there at six am it can load the oranges and be in Elmira at nine am 
okay so that seven boxes of oranges by nine am right 
yes it is 
okay I now finished 
hello can I help you 
um yes I need to take two boxcars of oranges to Avon by nine am 
and I need let see engine one um to leave let see okay um I need two boxcars to go to Avon from Elmira 
okay 
um and let see here um 
um let me see 
okay and how long does it take from them to get from Elmira to Avon 
do you wanna load them on the way 
no 
okay um it could either take you eight hours or it could take you six hours depending on which way you go 
if you go through Dansville it take you six hours if you go through Bath it will take you eight 
mm-hm 
okay so we wanna go through Dansville 
okay 
um and we should leave at midnight 
how long does it take um the cars to get from let me see here um um okay do okay do the boxcars originally start off in Elmira 
um there are boxcars in Dansville and there are boxcars in Elmira 
okay 
so wherever you want them to start 
okay um 
let me see here um okay how long how long does it take to get from Elmira to Corning 
it takes two hours 
okay so we need two boxcars to go from Elmira to Corning 
okay 
um and then how long is the trip from Corning to Avon 
um from Corning to Avon is four hours 
okay so if we leave at um at two am from Elmira to Corning 
and um fill those two boxcars with oranges and then transport the oranges from Corning to Avon by nine am 
um that will work 
okay great I am now finished 
hello can I help you 
um yes I like one tanker um one engine to leave Elmira with one tank of OJ to go to Avon by three pm 
um how long is that trip from Elmira to Avon 
from Elmira to Avon um is six hours or eight hours depending on which way you go 
okay and if it stops in Corning on the way 
does it need to stop in Corning and load 
yes it does 
um so that would either 
oh actually hold on one second um 
um okay no it wants to go directly to Avon 
it doesnot matter which way it goes it can go um the six hour route 
what needs to go directly to Avon 
we need to take one um one engine um with a tank of OJ to Avon from Elmira 
oh okay it depends on to get a tank of OJ first you need to pick up some oranges take them to Elmira turn it into orange juice 
okay 
and then take that to Avon 
okay so how long is um the route from Corning to Elmira 
Corning to Elmira is two hours 
okay so if we leave um Corning to Elmira with one tank of oranges 
you cannot carry oranges in a tanker and also you would need an engine there to carry the tanker 
okay 
so um 
we need one engine to go to Elmira to Corning um leave at midnight 
okay 
um and that would take two hours you said 
yes 
okay um and then take um one tank of oranges from Corning back to Elmira 
um as I said you cannot carry oranges in a tanker until they have been turned into orange juice you have to carry oranges in a boxcar until they are actually turned into juice 
okay okay so we want the boxcar to leave Elmira for Corning at midnight 
and pick up um the I guess the entire um pick up the load of oranges at Corning and bring them back to Elmira 
okay um do you want to take a tanker with that so you can 
yes I do 
okay um let see you get to Corning at two am it takes an hour to load the oranges 
mm-hm 
mm-hm 
and to put the the tanker on so you should be back in Elmira at five am 
okay um and how long does it can how long does it take to convert the oranges into orange juice 
it takes one hour 
okay um so if we leave Elmira at six am with one tank of orange juice 
uh-huh 
okay and then we need to take that to Avon 
okay 
and what time will we arrive there 
um it could you it can take you could take the eight hour way or the six hour way I assume you want to take the six hour way right 
okay 
right 
mm-hm 
you will be there at noon 
okay um and how long does it take um let see how long does it take to get from Avon to Corning did you say 
from Avon to Corning is four hours 
okay um let see we need to take a shorter route um 
so you trying to get what you need is to get one engine of orange juice from Elmira to Avon by three pm 
is that what the goal is 
um we need to get one tanker of orange juice to Avon and then pick up a boxcar of bananas 
oh okay 
and get it to Corning by three 
okay 
um 
you can run be running two things at the same time you donot necessarily have to do one and then the other 
okay 
you can be working on getting the bananas too 
oh okay I see 
at the same time 
okay then um okay then originally we need to have um the one boxcar go to um go to Corning from Elmira 
pick up the oranges and bring them back to Elmira to convert it into orange juice and get that to Avon 
okay that be there at noon 
okay and then also at midnight we need to send another boxcar to leave for Avon 
from where 
from Elmira 
okay um you need to run that about an hour behind 
okay 
the other engine 
that fine 
so it would leave at one 
okay that fine and um we need to pick up a boxcar of bananas in Avon 
okay um there are boxcars that are closer to Avon if that helps any 
um 
it doesnot really matter but okay if we if we leave from Bath we could leave from Bath to go to Avon um 
okay 
okay but then you have to get the engine to Bath so it probably 
if 
okay then never mind 
okay 
so 
leave from Elmira 
okay 
okay and what time would that what time would the boxcar arrive in Avon 
you want to get that to Avon that would get there at seven am 
okay and then we need to take that boxcar of bananas and bring it to Corning 
okay um that be there at noon let me make sure those trains are going to run into each other first though 
okay 
okay so this is leaving at six so from six to noon that be around there 
yeah if you if you send the bananas from Avon to Dansville or to Corning 
at eight am leaving Avon it would run into the orange juice going from Elmira to Avon 
mm-hm 
what is the soonest possible time that it could leave Avon to go to Corning 
um it could leave there at noon after the orange juice had gotten there and get to but then it would get to Corning by until four pm 
but it could go the other direction you could send it through Bath 
okay 
to Corning in which case it would get there at two pm 
okay 
alright 
okay I am now finished 
hello can I help you 
um yes I need to send let see how many um boxcars can one engine take 
if the boxcars are unloaded as many as it as it can and if they are loaded it can carry three 
okay um 
okay we need to send let see um okay we need to send two boxcars from Elmira to Avon 
okay 
to pick up a load of bananas 
okay which that the that your ultimate goal 
um that and we also need to send um one boxcar of oranges to Dansville 
okay 
um and both of these have to arrive by noon using only one engine and they must be unloaded by one pm 
okay 
um so if we if we leave um if the boxcars leave Elmira by um at midnight 
and arrive in Avon um how long will it take to load two boxcars of bananas 
that will take an hour 
okay um and so that entire route how long will that take 
okay you want to take the two boxcars from Elmira to Avon 
mm-hm 
which will take six hours 
okay 
so that get there at six am 
and then you want to load the bananas 
mm-hm 
and so that be loaded by seven am 
okay um 
um okay 
now originally you said that the engine can take as many um it can take up to three loaded boxcars 
yes 
okay um okay then originally we should send three um from Elmira to Avon 
um there are only two boxcars available at Elmira 
okay okay so we send the two boxcars from Elmira to Avon and pick up the two um let see we pick up the two loads of bananas and bring them to Dansville 
okay 
okay and what time will it arrive there 
that would be in Dansville at ten am 
okay um and how long does it take to unload 
um it takes let me see I believe it takes an hour yes 
okay um let see here um mm 
how long would it take to get from Dansville to Corning 
one hour 
okay um no let see 
we need to we should have both of the boxcars at Dansville by noon so 
we need a shorter route from we need to um manage to get the bananas to Dansville more quickly um 
okay you need to have them there by noon 
right and and the oranges as well 
as 
okay as it is the bananas are there at ten am but you also need to get a boxcar of oranges there 
right 
okay 
um okay so if it left Dansville um to Corning and loaded one boxcar of oranges at Corning and 
oh that right you need to do this all with one engine right 
right 
okay um so you wanna go from Dansville to Corning with another boxcar 
mm-hm and load one boxcar of oranges and bring them back to Dansville by noon 
okay it get to Corning at eleven am 
mm-hm 
um takes an hour to I mean eleven yeah am it takes an hour to load 
uh-oh- 
no would be loaded till noon 
yeah right 
um okay now 
um let see and now you can only carry food using the boxcars and not the tankers 
right 
okay um let see here uh 
um what if what if um the two boxcars left Elmira at midnight and went to Dansville 
um picked up a third boxcar and went to Corning to pick up the oranges there first how long would that take 
okay you want the two boxcars to leave Elmira 
mm-hm 
go directly to Dansville 
right 
okay they would be there at three am 
okay and 
they would get to Dansville at three am 
okay um and then how long would it take to add on an additional boxcar at Dansville and 
bring um the three cars to Corning and only load one of them with oranges at Corning 
okay um you could adding the boxcar the other boxcar doesnot take any time 
okay 
so you be back in Corning at four am 
okay 
then you want to load the oranges 
load one boxcar of oranges at Corning 
okay that would be loaded by five am 
okay and then if we take the shortest route from Corning to Avon 
mm-hm 
what time will we arrive in Avon 
you would be there at nine am 
okay and that probably 
AC because it would take you 
yeah that would take too long also 
yeah 
um okay 
hm is there hm um 
what you could do is you could take the boxcars from Elmira load the oranges at Corning and drop off the oranges at Dansville on your way to Avon 
okay and then how long would it take to um to okay once the oranges are dropped off at Dansville what time will that be 
let me see you want to leave Elmira 
mm-hm 
with the two boxcars 
right

okay 
and then I have to go from Elmira back to mm back to Corning back to Bath 
okay that be there at eleven am also 
okay 
so you all set 
yep 
hello how can I help you 
is there a tanker of OJ at Avon 
um no um the to make OJ you have to get a boxcar of oranges to Elmira where the OJ factory is and you need a tanker there to carry the OJ once it finished 
how long does it take a engine to get to go to Dansville pick up a boxcar go to Corning pick up oranges and go to Elmira 
okay from Avon to Dansville is one hour and it three hours excuse me 
so to get the engine and the boxcars to Corning will take you four hours cause it one hour from Dansville to Corning to load the oranges will take an additional hour so that five hours 
and then it two hours to Elmira so it seven hours to get the boxcars and the a boxcar and oranges to Elmira from Avon 
okay that would be it seven am 
yes 
if left now 
okay and the travel back would be another seven hours 
um no on the way back it would only be six because you would need to load 
load 
but you would at Elmira since you need 
it convert 
you need to convert and that takes an hour so it end up being seven hours on the way back also 
okay so think about this for a second that would that would make it in enough time I think 
twelve fourteen and three okay so 
I guess that would be one way of doing it and 
should I is it choose the best path or just one 
um just get the job done 
okay 
is is the important thing 
um 
what do you need to get done what are you trying to do 
get orange juice to Avon by three pm 
okay 
it is now midnight 
okay 
okay so 
follow the procedure of sending an engine one to Dansville pick up a boxcar go to Corning pick up oranges 
go to Elmira convert oranges pick up a oh tanker are tankers 
you could pick up a tanker in Corning on your way through 
yeah but can you have two things on the same train 
yes you can have up to three loaded 
okay then do that then 
okay 
at Corning pick up oranges and a tanker 
okay 
go to Elmira convert to oranges and transfer into a tanker 
alright 
how much time does it take to transfer to a tanker 
um that doesnot take any time it just takes an hour to make the orange juice 
okay 
so then from there take the tanker and might as well take the car too to Corning then to Dansville then to Avon 
should arrive at what time two pm 
yes 
then do it 
okay 
um done 
hello can I help you 
yes um 
how long would it take okay send engine two with two boxcars to Corning 
okay 
um 
send engine three also there 
okay it would have to leave about an hour later so that it would run into the first engine is that okay 
um yes 
okay 
then at that point have engine three pick up the two tankers 
okay 
and while that and go back to Elmira while engine two picking up two loads oh needs to pick up boxcars oh yeah it has boxcars while engine two picks up load of oranges 
then engine one while this is happening heads to Dansville 
okay 
to pick up three boxcars and then return how long would it take for Avon I mean engine one to go to Danville pick up boxcars and return to Avon 
it would be back in Avon at six am 
six am then return then from there to go to Danville 
you want to go back to Dansville again 
yes 
uh it would be back at nine am then 
um 
so you wanna you wanna go from Avon to Dansville back to Avon and then to Dansville again 
uh no go from Avon yeah Avon 
okay it three hours each way so 
okay it would get there before twelve 
um yes it would 
I mean noon okay then do that 
okay 
um what is what is engine okay engine two is 
you have you told 
it picking up the oranges and now it heading to Elmira but before that engine three picked up two tankers 
right 
and is at Elmira so then engine two converts its oranges into orange juice and 
okay 
and engine three carries the payload over to Corning 
okay it would be there at eight am 
okay how long I made a mistake about Avon 
um how long does it take from Avon to Bath 
Avon to Bath is four hours 
four hours so then for it to pick up bananas okay 
okay it takes an any time you want to load anything 
like the bananas or oranges it takes an hour 
it takes an hour 
okay I know 
for engine one to go to Danville and back to Avon it takes 
six hours 
six hours and to load would be 
that would be seven 
seven and then three hours or four hours to Bath so that would make it to Bath at what time 
eleven am 
eleven am okay no problem thought there was a problem 
okay 
so I jumping around 
but there um your orange juice is now at Coring do you understand what I mean by that 
um yes you got an 
from engine three converted it 
okay and yeah it can get 
and brought it to Corning 
and then to get to Danville from there 
it it it will be at Corning at eight am which means it could be at Dansville at nine am 
okay so that good 
okay is that what you need to do 
um did you understand what I said 
I understood what you said but I donot know what your ultimate goal is I so I donot know if you achieved it or not 
oh my ultimate goal is to ship three boxcars of bananas to Bath and two tankers to of OJ to Dansville 
okay 
by noon 
okay 
have I succeeded 
um 
yes you have 
then I am done 
okay 
hello can I help you 
hello um 
I guess no time requirement on anything else um engine two load up 
how long does it take engine two to what the shortest route from engine from for engine two at Elmira to reach Avon 
um it would take six hours 
six hours um 
send engine two to Dansville to pick up three boxcars 
okay 
and then send it to Avon to fill the engine the boxcars with bananas 
alright 
um send engine two back to Elmira 
is there a limit to how many boxcars can be at a town 
um no 
okay 
or how much two does materials have to stay in a boxcar if or is it or can they just deposit it at a town and continue to use the 
you can 
you can unload them but it would it takes an hour 
okay still so 
the engine two is now okay returns to Elmira 
yes 
with three boxcars of bananas um what time would that be 
four pm 
four pm 
mm-hm 
no problem um does it take time to switch boxcars 
no it doesnot 
okay um engine two picks up the two empty boxcars goes to Corning 
um picks up orange juice two loads of orange juice 
um you cannot pick up loads of orange juice you would have to get oranges 
oranges 
oranges 
you want to load oranges 
load oranges please 
okay 
and then move to Elmira it takes time to process 
yes an hour 
okay 
so you would have OJ by ten pm 
okay um actually there no time requirement for the orange juice so um I can take my pretty time 
okay 
so um 
pick up the oranges at Corning in the boxcars take them Elmira leave the boxcars there and process the orange juice 
and then engine two while it processing or before it processes goes to Corning to pick up two tankers 
okay you could take you could just take the tankers with you from that last time you were at Corning 
no I can only have three 
um if the tankers are empty it doesnot matter 
oh I can do that 
mm-hm 
then scratch that last when you at Corning pick up two tankers 
and then move okay pick up two tankers along with the oranges and go to Elmira 
okay 
transfer the orange juice and then 
take engine two with the two tankers over to Avon 
which would be the shortest route you know what it is Corning Dansville Avon 
right and that takes six hours so it would be there at four am 
okay that good 
so you got three boxcars of bananas at Elmira by four pm and two tankers of OJ at Avon by four am 
that done I now finished 
hello can I help you 
not right now 
okay 
by nine am it now midnight 
okay engine two send engine two with two boxcars to Corning to pick up oranges 
okay 
send engine three to Dansville to pick up two boxcars 
two boxcars 
yes 
okay 
or actually 
how many seven boxcars I have to hurry up 
how long would it take um no I not worried right now 
I need to get seven boxcars of oranges to Elmira by nine am 
okay 
and it now midnight as you know so I just telling you 
thanks 
um 
that always nice to know 
yeah 
um so engine two is now going to Corning to pick up with two boxcars to pick up oranges and 
mm-hm 
engine three is going to Dansville to pick up 
two boxcars 
um might as well be three 
okay 
and um then from there it will go to Corning um 
can they do it themselves without engine one is the question um 
how long would it take engine three to deliver two boxcars of oranges to Elmira 
um it two hours from Corning to Elmira 
so to go there train should be five in total 
uh yes 
Elmira is five and to do it again would be 
you mean to to go from Elmira to Corning load and go back to Elmira 
mm-hm 
that five hours yeah 
okay so it two trips total of four boxcars delivers would be done by 
um let me see you want to do this with engine E three 
yeah do it 
okay it it got three boxcars 
wait okay I talking engine two still 
oh engine two 
engine two 
okay 
go to Corning pick up oranges deliver to Elmira then do it again 
which is go to Corning pick up oranges go to Elmira 
okay 
could it do that by nine am 
okay as of three am it got one load of oranges at Corning so take those back to Elmira you get there at five am 
and you want to unload those and then go back to Corning and pick up two more loads 
so 
you couldnot do that by seven am 
well 
by nine let me see 
how many could you get four boxcars in Elmira 
um 
by nine am 
well you got these these three boxcars that you taken from Dansville 
oh yeah I working on that later 
oh okay 
I just figured that I could do it with just two and I mean just do engine two I think is going from Elmira is engine two going to Corning to Elmira or is it engine three is going to Dansville which one 
engine three is going to Dansville engine two is going Corning Elmira 
okay 
okay so as at five am it got engine two has brought two boxcars of oranges to to Elmira they there 
is at five 
uh-huh 
okay so could not do that if you did it again it be ten clock right 
let me see we unload them which would be six am go back to Corning it would be there by eight 
uh load up some more it would be back there at eleven am 
no 
which is too late okay um how long does it take engine one to go to Bath 
it would take four hours 
and then okay from engine one to go to doesnot take time to pick up boxcars correct 
no no time at all 
okay engine one to go to Corning how long does it take 
um it could take four hours or six hours depending on which way that you went 
uh it necessary to go to Bath to pick up 
you need to go to Bath on your way it would be six hours 
six hours then to pick up oranges at Corning is an extra hour 
mm-hm 
then another 
then it two hours from there to Elmira 
okay so that would be at it would arrive at what time 
okay leaving Avon at midnight um go to Bath you get to Corning at six am load the oranges you would be in Elmira at nine am 
okay that would be two loads correct 
right 
okay then send okay this is is should have done this in the beginning engine three 
mm-hm 
is going to Dansville picking up three boxcars 
right 
then picking up oranges 
uh-huh 
at Corning 
and then going to Elmira how long when would that be done 
it would be there at seven am 
and then engine two could go to Corning pick up oranges and go back by 
five am 
okay so 
I think I explained it I can go over engine one going to Bath picking up cars picking up oranges at Corning and then going to Elmira engine two is going to Corning picking with two boxcars 
mm-hm 
getting oranges and going back to Elmira 
and then engine three is going to Dansville it picking up three boxcars going to Corning picking up oranges and then going to Elmira 
right so you got 
and that will all be done by 
um at the the last one will get there at nine am 
okay that then that the problem solved I am now finished 
hello can I help you 
yes you may I have to transport two boxcars of bananas to Corning by eleven am and right now it midnight 
hold on two boxcars 
mm-hm 
of bananas 
right 
to Corning

by midnight 
by midnight mm-hm 
alright 
and right now it eleven am so we got about thirteen hours to do this 
okay 
am I right 
yeah 
yep 
um so we in Avon there a banana warehouse right here are we starting from Avon 
we can start anywhere 
anywhere we want 
we just have to get that where the um the banana warehouse is 
right so that probably be the best place to start okay 
right 
so we gonna have this engine we gonna hook it up to a boxcar in um Dansville to two boxcars in Dansville 
alright 
and then um we just take it on down to Corning 
okay now wait a minute um we donot have any bananas yet 
what do you mean oh that right okay cause the engine doesnot carry bananas alright alright we get the engine we go get the two boxcars 
right 
turn back go you know go back to Avon pick up the bananas 
right 
and mm yeah it looks it it looks like about the same um distance to go from Avon back down to Bath 
it a little longer 
oh it is 
are are we going we ending up in Corning so 
yeah so alright 
to go to go to Avon Dansville Corning that a bit faster than going uh 
okay 
than going down to uh to Bath 
it one hour faster 
alright well then that sounds good we do that 
we go from Avon to Dansville with the two boxcars go back to Avon get the bananas go back to Dansville and on down to Corning 
okay so that gonna take uh ten eleven twelve thirteen hours 
oh that is okay 
yes 
so we to start right now 
right 
okay 
by eleven am yeah right 
mm-hm 
okay 
okay 
can I help you 
yes you can I have to ship two boxcars of bananas and two boxcars of oranges to Dansville and all cargo must arrive at ten am 
okay 
so let me see two boxcars of bananas 
I have to wait and two boxcars of oranges 
so I have to get the boxcars 
and let see if we start at Bath 
and let me see I guess I donot know I we can start at Bath 
get the well no we need the engine we need to start the engine 
mm-hm 
alright start at Avon get the engine 
oh I should tell you that you can only um pull three loaded boxcars at a time 
yes 
oh okay so why donot we go from Avon to Bath get um two boxcars 
okay 
and go back up and get bananas and bring it to Dansville and empty the boxcars the two boxcars 
and then go down to Corning to get the oranges then go back up to Dansville 
okay sounds good let see if that 
sounds good 
I want to see if we have enough time 
okay 
so we starting in Avon 
mm-hm 
and that gonna take four hours to get to Bath 
mm-hm 
another four hours to get back to Avon 
okay 
um and then in three hours to get to Dansville 
yeah 
so that eight nine ten eleven and then um 
we have to get the oranges 
and then we go back to 
then we go to Corning yeah right eleven twelve thirteen so that thirteen hours 
mm-hm 
okay 
and we want when was our finishing time 
ten am 
ten am so that that not enough that not enough time right 
mm-hm 
right 
so we need to shave off 
so there something well hm let see 
let see um 
hm 
where our time being lost 
mm 
uh when we 
well we going from Avon to Bath and then back to Avon why donot we go from Avon to Dansville to get the three boxcars 
I donot know if because that a little shorter time I guess from 
right 
well we can use other engines also 
oh 
so so you can uh at the same time that you at you going to get the oranges the bananas you can go get oranges with another engine 
so you could use an engine at uh Elmira for instance 
oh 
along with the engine at Avon 
okay well how can I be in two different places at the same time 
no it it it just the we making a 
I the manager 
right 
right okay 
so we gonna take actually there engines and boxcars available here 
so why donot we cinch it by getting one engine and the two boxcars go in and get the two oranges and go to Dansville that be our orange deal 
the orange route 
alright 
okay 
and then we go from Avon well yeah and then at the same time we use that other engine 
yep 
and hold on a minute yeah and then we go to Dansville get the three boxcars 
um go to Avon get the bananas and then just go back to Dansville 
okay 
so that so the bananas takes 
longer 
takes six hours 
mm-hm 
and uh the other one takes um let see well right so that gonna take three hours to get to Dansville from Avon with the engine 
three hours to get back with the boxcars 
mm-hm 
that six hours 
mm-hm 
and then um an hour to load 
okay 
seven hours and then three hours to get back so that ten hours so that work 
okay 
and then um 
then at the same time 
at the same time we we getting an engine from Elmira with the boxcars 
mm-hm
